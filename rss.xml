<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English Summary：</h2>  Xpeng unveils plans to launch its flying car, marking its entry into the urban air mobility market. The company showcased two types of flying vehicles at CES 2024, including an international debut of its new AeroHT eVTOL model. While aiming to deliver the first batch of flying cars by late 2025, Xpeng acknowledges the need for regulatory approvals and focuses on a consumer market where it can introduce the flying experience and gradually expand to urban transportation. CEO Brian Gu emphasized their distinction from EHang's products, targeting a broader consumer base and integrating vehicle and aircraft capabilities. The company is in discussions with Chinese regulators but recognizes that international expansion faces geopolitical challenges, exemplified by DJI's inclusion on the US Entity List.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Xpeng's entry into the flying car market with a focus on consumer experience and gradual regulatory integration.</li>    <li>Theme: Unveiling flying car models, discussing regulatory challenges, and targeting a consumer-focused market.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: Xpeng's strategy to introduce the flying experience to consumers while seeking regulatory approvals and addressing geopolitical tensions.</li>    <li>Main information: Showcase of flying car models at CES, pre-order and delivery plans, emphasis on consumer market, comparison with EHang's products, discussions with Chinese regulators, and consideration of global expansion challenges.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>中文总结：</h2>  小鹏汽车正式发布旗下首款飞行汽车，宣告进军城市空中出行市场。该公司在 2024 年国际消费电子展 (CES) 上展示了两款飞行汽车，其中 AeroHT eVTOL 型号是国际首发。小鹏汽车计划在 2025 年第四季度交付第一批飞行汽车，但对监管部门的审批持观望态度，并专注于消费者市场，希望先让人们体验飞行再等待法规框架的完善，逐步实现城市交通服务。首席执行官顾宏地强调了他们与亿航产品的区别，瞄准更广泛的消费群体，并整合了汽车和飞行器的功能。该公司正在与中国监管机构进行谈判，但意识到国际扩张面临着地缘政治挑战，例如大疆被纳入美国实体清单就是一个例子。  <ul>    <li>摘要：小鹏汽车进入飞行汽车市场，关注消费者体验和循序渐进的监管整合。</li>    <li>主题：发布飞行汽车型号、探讨监管挑战、面向消费者的市场目标。</li>    <li>观点：小鹏汽车的策略是在寻求监管批准和应对地缘政治紧张局势的同时，向消费者推出飞行体验。</li>    <li>主要信息：在 CES 上展示飞行汽车型号、预订和交付计划、强调消费市场、与亿航产品对比、与中国监管机构讨论、考虑全球扩张挑战。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>debut (n.) - /ˈdeɪbjuː/ 首次登场，首演。    <p>原文例句：Seven years after EHang debuted its first passenger drone, Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng entered the market with its own “flying car”. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于法语，表示“首次登场，首演”。在这个例句中，它指的是亿航在七年后推出了自己的第一款载人无人机，而中国电动汽车制造商小鹏汽车则带着自己的“飞行汽车”进入了市场。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>modular (adj.) - /ˈmɒdjʊlə/ 模块化的，单元化的。    <p>原文例句：Its modular Land Aircraft Carrier will start taking pre-orders in the fourth quarter this year, with deliveries to start a year later. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，表示“模块化的，单元化的”。在这个例句中，它指的是小鹏汽车的模块化陆地航空母舰将在今年第四季度开始接受预订，并于一年后开始交付。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>sportier (adj.) - /ˈspɔːtiə/ 更运动的，更具运动感的。    <p>原文例句：The sportier AeroHT eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) car made its international debut at the show, having previously conducted flying tests in China. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于sport（运动），表示“更运动的，更具运动感的”。在这个例句中，它指的是更运动的 AeroHT eVTOL（电动垂直起降）汽车在展会上首次亮相，此前已在中国进行了飞行测试。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>urban air mobility - 城市空中出行。    <p>原文例句：Xpeng unveils plans to launch its flying car, marking its entry into the urban air mobility market. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由urban（城市）, air（空气）和mobility（出行）组成，表示“城市空中出行”。在这个例句中，它指的是小鹏汽车发布了推出飞行汽车的计划，标志着其进入城市空中出行市场。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>international debut - 国际首发。    <p>原文例句：The sportier AeroHT eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) car made its international debut at the show. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由international（国际）和debut（首次登场）组成，表示“国际首发”。在这个例句中，它指的是更运动的 AeroHT eVTOL（电动垂直起降）汽车在展会上首次亮相。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>The company’s subsidiary AeroHT presented two types of flying cars at CES 2024 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. - 周二，该公司旗下的 AeroHT 在拉斯维加斯举行的 CES 2024 上展出了两种类型的飞行汽车。    <p>句子分析：这个句子是一个简单句，主语是 The company’s subsidiary AeroHT，谓语是 presented，宾语是 two types of flying cars。介词短语 at CES 2024 in Las Vegas on Tuesday 表示时间和地点，修饰谓语 presented。这个句子的意思是说，周二，该公司旗下的 AeroHT 在拉斯维加斯举行的 CES 2024 上展出了两种类型的飞行汽车。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>现在完成时 - 表示从过去的一个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：Seven years after EHang debuted its first passenger drone, Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng entered the market with its own “flying car”. </p>    <p>语法讲解：这个时态表示从过去的一个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。结构是：have/has + been + 过去分词。这个时态经常用于谈论过去开始到现在仍然持续的动作或状态。在这个例句中，它表示亿航在七年前推出了第一架载人无人机，而中国电动汽车制造商小鹏汽车则带着自己的“飞行汽车”进入了市场。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>The company’s subsidiary AeroHT presented two types of flying cars at CES, including a sportier eVTOL that made its international debut</li>

It has been demoed for flying in China, but it did not take flight at CES. Brian Gu Hongdi, vice-chairman and president of Xpeng, suggested it could launch before regulations are in place for city use, but that people could eventually buy one and fly it in areas where the use of aircraft is not regulated.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247808/ces-2024-china-tv-makers-hisense-and-tcl-promote-ai-live-sports-us-show" title="">Hisense and TCL push AI in TVs, chase industry trends like smart cars</a></h3><p>“The design of our vehicles is not targeted for urban transportation … [which] requires an extensive regulatory approval process,” Gu said. “That’s why we’re targeting a consumer market, for people to first enjoy the experience of flying and then obviously with the regulatory framework in place, we gradually can move towards urban transportation.”</p><p>While Gu said it was too early to say what pricing might be, he expects it to be “similar to buying a luxury performance car”.</p><p>Similar products have been in the works for years.

The EV company, which made its debut at CES two years after EHang with its first car, noted that EHang’s products are just aerial vehicles without the ability to be driven on roads. EHang is also targeting enterprise use, while Xpeng is targeting a wider consumer base.</p><p>“We are targeting the consumer market, which is very different,” Gu said. “I don’t see another company that’s doing that right now.”</p><p>While Xpeng has also highlighted how the Land Aircraft Carrier could be used for public services like emergency rescue, the new eVTOL car is a more stylish option that can conceal its rotors. This will presumably make it more appealing for people to buy, whenever it becomes available, even if they cannot fly it to work every morning.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/gadgets/article/3247413/ai-will-be-spotlight-consumer-electronics-show-2024-glasses-blind-shoes-make-you-walk-faster-and" title="">AI to dominate CES 2024, with glasses for blind, shoes to walk faster</a></h3><p>Gu said the company is already in talks with regulators in China but international expansion “takes time”.</p><p>Xpeng’s ambitions could face some challenges with current geopolitical tensions, though. Chinese drone tech has been caught in the cross hairs before. Washington put DJI, the world’s largest consumer drone maker, on its Entity List that bars US companies from doing business with it without express approval.</p><p>When asked whether this could present some hurdles, Gu said, “I’m not even thinking about that right now … This business is purely focused on the China market right now.”</p> ]]></description>

<link>https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247936/tsmc-halts-revenue-drop-beats-expectations-brisk-demand-ai-chips-nvidia-advanced-micro-devices</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  In the fourth quarter of 2023, TSMC, a major chip manufacturing company, reported revenues that matched earnings from the same period in the previous year, overcoming analyst expectations and its own projections. However, the overall revenue saw a decline of 4.5% to NT$2.16 trillion. Despite this, TSMC's high-performance computing business witnessed growth due to increasing demand for AI chips.

</ul><p>A highly anticipated decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether to approve a spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) quickly morphed into a major cybersecurity incident on Tuesday.</p><p>The SEC’s X account was compromised and a fake post claiming that the agency had greenlit plans for the products fuelled a brief surge in the price of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. It also has sparked an investigation by US authorities into how a social media account at Wall Street’s main regulator was compromised.</p><p>“It really shows the breadth and frequency of cyberattacks,” said Kurt Gottschall, a partner at law firm Haynes Boone and former SEC regional director. “The irony here is that the SEC has not shown much sympathy to public companies and asset managers that have experienced cybersecurity incidents.”</p><p>The breach gave fodder to crypto faithful who have long viewed the commission’s chairman, Gary Gensler, as an enemy due to his zeal to rein in the industry.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="SEC chairman Gary Gensler at a congress hearing in September.

In a separate statement, Gensler clarified that no decision on ETFs had been made.</p><p>The SEC said that there was unapproved activity on the @SECGov X account “by an unknown party for a brief period of time shortly after 4pm ET” on Tuesday. After the fake post was removed, Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, said in a statement that the “account is secure and we are investigating the root cause”.</p><p>About a dozen companies have applied to list ETFs backed by bitcoin in the US. The SEC has until January 10 to take action on at least one of those applications, and crypto insiders have speculated the regulator will use that date to announce a slew of decisions at once.</p><p>There are two technical requirements that must be fulfilled before a spot-backed bitcoin ETF can start trading. First, the SEC must sign off on so-called 19b-4 filings by the exchanges that would list the ETFs. Second, the regulator must approve the relevant S-1 forms, which are the registration applications from the would-be issuers – a list that includes BlackRock and Fidelity.</p><p>The SEC is planning to vote on the exchanges’ filings, the 19b-4s, this week, Bloomberg News has reported. The regulator may or may not take action on the issuers’ applications, the S-1s, around the same time. If the SEC grants both sets of required approvals, the ETFs could start trading as soon as the next business day.</p><p>The SEC under Gensler and his Trump-era predecessor, Jay Clayton, has previously refused to allow such a product to launch, citing concerns about investor protection and the potential for market manipulation. However, speculation has been mounting since August, when the SEC lost a key legal fight against crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments, that the regulator will have to acquiesce to the growing clamour for the product.</p><p>Hype about an approval has been rampant on social media. Bitcoin surged as much as 10 per cent on October 16 when a crypto news site incorrectly posted on X that BlackRock had been approved to list a spot ETF. About US$85 million of mostly bearish trading positions were liquidated during the surge, which quickly reversed.</p> ]]></description>

They also boasted about their supply chain prowess and the ability to manufacture leading technologies in-house.</p><p>David Gold, president of Hisense USA, said the company’s ability to produce displays and even its own AI chipsets without third parties is something that sets it apart.</p><p>“When you think about global players, I think we are one of less than a handful of companies that have everything that it takes to be able to truly provide a smart home solution,” Gold said after the Hisense presentation. “We have all the ingredients, all the components. There are very few companies out there that can do the same.”</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247657/ces-2024-chinese-tech-giants-alibaba-bytedance-lead-chinas-return-premier-consumer-electronics-show" title="">Tech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China’s return to CES</a></h3><p>The flagship product from Hisense this year is its new 110-inch ULED X television with a brightness of 10,000 nits and 40,000 backlight zones.</p><p>Not to be outdone, TCL announced what it said is the world’s largest mini-LED TV at 115 inches. TCL referred to itself as a “great global power” with 32 research and development centres and 43 manufacturing sites around the world.</p><p>Mini LEDs featured prominently in the presentations of both Hisense and TCL, as they each presented their brands as the best option for finding this tech in TVs that cost just a few hundred dollars, rather than thousands.</p><p>Hisense said that mini LEDs – which cram more LEDs into a display to offer a greater range of contrast and image quality – are now integrated into all its models, including one for under US$500.</p><p>Hisense also introduced its new so-called laser TVs, which are projectors combined with an ambient-light-rejecting screen. The company said its newest 8K Sonic Laser TV is the “world’s largest sound-emitting screen”, offering a sound bar-like experience built into the projector. It is also offering a new Rollable Laser TV, which is exactly what it sounds like: a projector screen that rolls up and disappears, offering a cleaner look at home when not in use.</p><p>Both companies used sports to draw attention to their new TVs. As more viewers switch to streaming, the focus on live television has largely fallen to sports, a major reason households remain subscribed to cable and satellite TV packages.</p><p>TCL leaned into this heavily, inviting sportscasters including Charissa Thompson and former National Football League player Charles Woodson on stage for nearly the entire duration of the presentation.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL Communication, introduces the RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, January 8, 2024.

What we’re trying to do with AI is automatically detect, ‘Oh, now you’re watching football, let’s move to a sport setting’.”</p><p>Seemingly omnipresent at CES 2024, AI was mentioned repeatedly during both presentations, as it has been by rivals like Samsung and LG.</p><p>TCL talked of enhancing access to its AI processing with three levels of its AIPQ processors, which include “pro” and “ultra” versions. The AI processors are now offered in its cheaper S Class series.</p><p>While TVs are typically the highlight for these events from the Chinese display giants, they are also chasing other trends in the industry. TCL mentioned the latest version of the RayNeo X2 smart glasses, which can display images on the lenses to do things like offer real-time text translation. TCL incubated RayNeo.</p><p>The company also highlighted its newest smartphones and tablets with an emphasis on its Nxtpaper display, which is meant to be easier on the eyes like e-reader displays.</p><p>Hisense is working on its own augmented reality (AR) glasses and a virtual reality headset, but both are just prototypes for now.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="Hisense US president David Gold speaks during a presentation at CES 2024, January 8, 2024.

It is working on bringing its projector technology into cars to, among other things, turn the windscreen into an AR display. The company said this enhances safety because drivers do not need to take their eyes off the road when getting information like navigation.</p><p>“If you’re on the road and your smart refrigerator can tell you, ‘hey, you’re out of eggs; so on your way home, stop by and pick up some eggs,’ that’s the idea that we’re going for,” Gold said.</p><p>Many tech firms are betting on cars as the next big area of growth.
