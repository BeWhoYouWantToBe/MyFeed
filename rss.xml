<title>Tech war: China chip imports fall in 2023 but semiconductors remain country’s largest item ahead of crude oil</title>
<link>https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3248269/tech-war-china-chip-imports-fall-2023-semiconductors-remain-countrys-largest-item-ahead-crude-oil</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  China's imports of integrated circuits (IC) declined in 2023 in terms of both volume and value, despite remaining the country's largest import item ahead of crude oil. This drop reflects economic headwinds and ongoing efforts to promote domestic chip production and reduce reliance on imports. The United States' export control measures, including restrictions on advanced chips, have also contributed to this trend.    <ul>    <li>Abstract: China's chip imports fell in 2023 due to economic challenges and domestic production efforts.</li>    <li>Theme: China's efforts to boost domestic chip production and reduce reliance on imported chips, amidst economic headwinds and US export control measures.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: The impact of US export controls on China's chip industry; the potential of China's domestic chip production efforts.</li>    <li>Main information: Decline in China's IC imports in 2023; China's increased focus on local chip production; US export control measures targeting advanced chips.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  中国进口集成电路（IC）在 2023 年無論是数量还是价值都有所下降，尽管它仍然是中国最大的进口项目，超过原油。这种下降反映了经济阻力以及正在进行的促进国产芯片生产和减少对进口依赖的努力。包括对先进芯片的限制在内的美国的出口管制措施也促成了这一趋势。  <ul>    <li>摘要：由于经济挑战和国内生产努力，中国芯片进口在 2023 年下降。</li>    <li>主题：中国在经济阻力和美国出口管制措施中努力提升国内芯片生产并减少对进口芯片的依赖。</li>    <li>观点：美国出口管制对中国芯片行业的影响；中国国产芯片生产努力的潜力。</li>    <li>主要信息：2023 年中国 IC 进口下降；中国加大了对本地芯片生产的关注；针对先进芯片的美国出口管制措施。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>semiconductors (n.) - /ˈsɛmɪˌkʌnˈdʌktərz/ 半导体。    <p>原文例句：China’s imports of integrated circuits (IC) plunged by both volume and value in 2023, although semiconductors remained the mainland’s largest import item ahead of crude oil.</p>    <p>例句讲解：semiconductors 是“半导体”的意思，它是一种能够导电，但导电性介于导体和绝缘体之间的材料。半导体在电子工业中有着广泛的应用，包括集成电路、二极管、晶体管等。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>economic headwinds (n.) - 经济逆风，经济阻力。    <p>原文例句：China chip imports fall in 2023 on economic headwinds and localisation efforts.</p>    <p>例句讲解：economic headwinds 是“经济阻力”的意思，它指经济发展中遇到的困难或挑战。这些困难或挑战可能来自内部或外部，包括经济衰退、通货膨胀、高失业率、贸易逆差等。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>China is making solid progress in boosting local output of legacy chips, including those being used in cars and home appliances, to satisfy domestic demand.- 中国在提高本地传统芯片的产量方面取得了坚实进展，包括那些用于汽车和家电的芯片，以满足国内需求。<p>句子分析：这是一个复合句，主句是China is making solid progress，其中主语是China，谓语是is making solid progress，宾语是progress。in boosting local output of legacy chips, including those being used in cars and home appliances, to satisfy domestic demand是一个现在分词短语作状语，表示中国在提高本地传统芯片的产量方面取得了坚实进展的原因或目的，即为了满足国内需求。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>现在完成时 - 表示从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：China is unable to directly buy advanced chips, such as the H100 and A100 graphics processing units designed by US-based Nvidia.</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个常见的时态，结构是：have/has + been + 过去分词。其中have/has要根据主语的人称和数进行变化，been是be的过去分词，过去分词是动词的-ed或-en形式。这种时态表示动作或状态从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在，强调动作或状态的持续性和未完成性。在这个例句中，it表示中国从过去的某个时间开始一直持续到现在都无法直接购买先进芯片，动作或状态持续性尚未完成。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>In 2023, China imported a total of 479.5 billion IC units worth US$349.4 billion</li>
<li>Under rigid US export measures, China is unable to directly purchase advanced chips such as Nvidia’s H100 and A100 GPUs</li>

Photo: Shutterstock </figcaption></figure><p>China’s imports of integrated circuits (IC) plunged by both volume and value in 2023, although semiconductors remained the mainland’s largest import item ahead of crude oil, according to customs data released on Friday.</p><p>In 2023, China imported a total of 479.5 billion IC units worth US$349.4 billion, down 10.8 per cent by volume and 15.4 per cent in value from 2022, official data showed. By comparison, the country spent US$337.5 billion importing crude oil last year, a fall of 7.7 per cent.</p><p>The weaker imports of ICs and semiconductor devices reflect economic headwinds in the world’s second-largest economy last year, in particular China’s weak smartphone and laptop sales. Meanwhile, the data was also affected by China’s efforts to boost local output to cut reliance on imported chips.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3248095/nvidia-reveals-progress-chinas-self-driving-chip-market-setting-competition-domestic-players" title="">Nvidia reveals progress in China’s self-driving chip market as competition revs up</a></h3><p>Under rigid US export control measures, China is unable to directly buy advanced chips, such as the H100 and A100 graphics processing units designed by US-based Nvidia. However, the country is making solid progress in boosting local output of legacy chips, including those being used in cars and home appliances, to satisfy domestic demand.</p><p>According to the customs data, China’s imports of diodes and similar semiconductor devices, a proxy of garden-variety commodity chips, were also down by 23.8 per cent in volume terms last year.</p><p>The US intensified its export controls on China in October 2022, which caused widespread disruption for global fabless and semiconductor tools companies in their China-related businesses. In October last year, the US further tightened the noose, cutting China’s access to workaround chips that Nvidia had tailor-made for mainland customers.</p><p>In a state-backed drive to build a more resilient domestic chip supply chain, China’s semiconductor players have upped their localisation efforts with closer cooperation between the biggest companies. These efforts may also have contributed to the decline of imported chips as China added mature capacity to enable production of the vast majority of chips locally.</p><p>China currently has 44 semiconductor wafer fabs in operation and a further 22 under construction, Taiwan-based IC research company TrendForce said in a recent note. By the end of 2024, the capacity for mature chip production – defined as 28-nanometre and older technologies – will be expanded at 32 Chinese fabs.</p><p>The massive expansion, which has caused alarm in the US and EU, will see China’s global share of mature process capacity reach 39 per cent by 2027, up from 31 per cent in 2023, with room for further growth if equipment procurement proceeds smoothly, the TrendForce note said.</p> ]]></description>

<link>https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3248171/tesla-cuts-prices-china-model-3-and-model-y-evs-keep-commanding-lead-premium-segment-fast-growing</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  Tesla has cut the prices of its Shanghai-made vehicles by up to 6%, aiming to maintain its leading position in China's premium electric vehicle (EV) market. Facing strong competition from Chinese home-grown rivals like Li Auto, Xpeng, and BYD, Tesla is looking to sustain its market share. Despite a 15.7% month-on-month sales growth in December, the overall growth rate in 2023 was similar to that of 2022, and sales growth in China is projected to slow in 2024. Other EV makers like BYD and Xpeng have also resorted to price cuts to attract customers.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Tesla reduces prices in China amidst rising competition from domestic EV brands.</li>    <li>Theme: Tesla's price cuts in China, reflecting the intensifying competition in the premium EV market.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: The importance of maintaining market share in the highly competitive Chinese EV space.</li>    <li>Main information: Tesla's price cuts across its Model 3 and Model Y range, the growth in sales in China, and the overall trends and challenges in the Chinese EV market.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  特斯拉下调了其在上海制造的汽车的价格，最高降幅达 6%，旨在维持其在中国高级电动汽车 (EV) 市场上的领先地位。面对来自李汽车、小鹏和比亚迪等中国本土对手的强烈竞争，特斯拉正寻求维持其市场份额。尽管 12 月销量环比增长 15.7%，但 2023 年的整体增长速度与 2022 年相似，预计 2024 年中国销量增长将放缓。其他电动汽车制造商，如比亚迪和小鹏，也已采取降价措施以吸引消费者。  <ul>    <li>摘要：特斯拉在中国降价，以应对来自本土电动汽车品牌的日益激烈的竞争。</li>    <li>主题：特斯拉在中国降价，反映了高级电动汽车市场竞争日益激烈。</li>    <li>观点：在竞争激烈的中国电动汽车领域维持市场份额的重要性。</li>    <li>主要信息：特斯拉在其 Model 3 和 Model Y 车型中全线降价，中国销量增长，以及中国电动汽车市场的整体趋势和挑战。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>rival (n.) - /ˈraɪvəl/ 对手，竞争对手。    <p>原文例句：Tesla apparently hopes to maintain its market share in the highly competitive market,” said Phate Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based EV data provider CnEVPost. “Chinese home-grown rivals have launched a raft of new intelligent electric cars to mount a challenge to the US EV builder.”</p>    <p>例句讲解：rival 表示“对手、竞争对手”，通常用于竞争或对抗的情况下。在这个例句中，rival 指的是特斯拉的竞争对手，主要是中国本土的电动汽车制造商，如比亚迪、小鹏等。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>spearhead (v.) - /ˈspɪərˌhɛd/ 带头，领导。    <p>原文例句：Intensifying competition is piling pressure on the 200-plus Chinese EV makers this year, with some leading players spearheading price cuts to lure customers.</p>    <p>例句讲解：spearhead 表示“带头、领导”，通常用于比喻某人或某事在某一领域或活动中处于领先或主导地位。在这个例句中，spearhead 指的是一些领先的中国电动汽车制造商，它们率先降价以吸引消费者，从而在竞争中占据优势。</p></li>  </ul>  </div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>by up to - 最多可达，至多。    <p>原文例句：Tesla has cut the prices of its Shanghai-made vehicles by up to 6 per cent as it works to maintain its leading position in the premium segment of the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market.</p>    <p>例句讲解：by up to 表示“最多可达”，通常用于表示某一数量或范围的最高限度。在这个例句中，by up to 6 per cent 表示特斯拉将其在上海制造的汽车的价格最高下调了 6%。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>on par with - 与……相当，与……齐平。    <p>原文例句：The growth was nearly unchanged from the 37 per cent sales rise recorded in 2022 when it delivered about 440,000 vehicles.</p>    <p>例句讲解：on par with 表示“与……相当，与……齐平”，通常用于比较两个或多个对象或事物之间的相似度或一致性。在这个例句中，on par with 表示 2023 年的销售增长与 2022 年的销售增长几乎持平。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>Tesla has cut the prices of its Shanghai-made vehicles by up to 6 per cent as it works to maintain its leading position in the premium segment of the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market. - 特斯拉下调了其在上海制造的汽车的价格，最高降幅达 6%，旨在维持其在中国高级电动汽车 (EV) 市场上的领先地位。    <p>句子分析：本句为复句，主句是 Tesla has cut the prices，其语序为主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 状语。cut 是动词，表示“切割、削减”。prices 是宾语，意为“价格”。Shanghai-made vehicles 是由定冠词 the 和过去分词 Shanghai-made 修饰的复合宾语，意为“上海制造的汽车”。 状语 by up to 6 per cent 表示降价幅度最高可达 6%。从句 as it works to maintain its leading position in the premium segment of the world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) market 为定语从句，修饰先行词 Tesla，解释特斯拉降价的原因是维持其在全球最大的电动汽车市场的高级细分市场的领先地位。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>形容词比较级 - 表示两个或多个事物或人之间的比较。    <p>原文例句：Tesla also lowered the price of the dual-motor version of the Model 3 by 3.9 per cent to 285,900 yuan and offered a 2.1 per cent discount on the dual-motor Model Y, which now sells for 299,900 yuan.</p>    <p>语法讲解：形容词比较级是形容词的一种形式，用于比较两个或多个事物或人之间的差异。比较级通常通过在形容词词尾加 -er 或 more 来形成。在这个例句中，lower 表示“更低”，是形容词 low 的比较级。cheaper 表示“更便宜”，是形容词 cheap 的比较级。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>过去时态 - 表示过去发生的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：Tesla China cut prices on its Chinese-made models six times since January 2020.</p>    <p>语法讲解：过去时态是动词的一种时态，用于表示过去发生的动作或状态。过去时态的形成一般是：has/have/had + 过去分词。在这个例句中，cut 是动词，过去分词是 cut。这句话的意思是：自 2020 年 1 月以来，特斯拉中国公司六次下调其中国制造车型的价格。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Carmaker cut prices by up to 6 per cent after reporting 15.7 per cent month-on-month sales growth to 75,805 units in mainland China in December</li>

Disclosures filed by Google with the state of California show that 630 workers in the state have been let go this week, including four vice-presidents and 25 directors. Employees at those levels often earn millions of dollars per year in compensation, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.</p><p>The Alphabet Workers Union, which represents some Google employees, said more than 1,000 workers have been let go so far in total.</p><p>The co-founders of Fitbit, James Park and Eric Friedman, are also leaving Google as part of the reorganisation, a company spokesperson confirmed. Google acquired the smartwatch company in 2019 for US$2.1 billion.</p><p>Workers at the search giant have been on edge since January of last year, when Alphabet said it would <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/3207638/google-parent-company-alphabet-lay-12000-workers-ai-focus-intensifies" target="_self" title="">cut about 12,000 jobs</a>, more than 6 per cent of its global workforce. That sent shock waves through Silicon Valley.</p><p>The company continued to make smaller trims over the course of 2023, including lay-offs within teams focused on recruiting, news products and the Waze mapping app.</p><p>While the large round of cuts in January 2023 was telegraphed by Alphabet chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, this year’s reductions have been communicated by lower-level leaders, such as vice-presidents and human resources, according to a current employee and a former worker.</p><p>Googlers and recently laid-off employees shared information with each other about the cuts in Discord chats, hallway conversations and other social networks, two current employees told Bloomberg. A document noting which roles got cut, as well as resources for laid-off coworkers, circulated among workers on Wednesday and Thursday, one worker said.</p><p>Staffers thought the company leadership would have learned from <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3208941/google-workers-stage-rallies-against-job-cuts-low-wages" target="_self" title="">the outcry that large-scale job losses provoked</a> last year, a current employee said, noting that Google is focused almost exclusively on cost-cutting now. The employee said everyone is talking about having a Plan B.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3239082/microsofts-bets-generative-ai-boost-azure-cloud-business-alphabets-google-cloud-disappoints" title="">Microsoft’s AI bets lift cloud business, as Google Cloud disappoints</a></h3><p>Workers said it was difficult to get a full picture of how many jobs were affected. Google – which had about 182,000 employees as of September 30, according to regulatory filings – said more cuts could be expected throughout January as decisions are made at the department level.</p><p>The company employed 190,700 workers before the lay-offs last year, in addition to tens of thousands of contractors around the world.</p><p>One of the Google employees who lost his job this week said the first sign of trouble came when he tried to check his work email, only to find he had been logged off. He found a message delivering the news that he had lost his job in his personal email.</p><p>Over the past year, there have been several rounds of micro-lay-offs, the worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions. He said it has killed morale at the company and is not conducive to creating trust.</p><p>Some Googlers have come to view January as a new grim annual tradition of mass lay-offs.</p><p>While Google executives have framed the cuts as a way to refocus resources on the company’s biggest priorities, the worker who was just fired said that he and a number of his teammates who were let go were working on AI.</p><p>Amazon.com also laid off hundreds of staff in its Prime Video and studios business this week, raising questions about whether another major round of job cuts was under way in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Semafor first reported the lay-offs to the Google Assistant team, while 9to5Google first reported the reorganisation for hardware. Affected staff have begun receiving the news and will have the opportunity to apply for open positions elsewhere within Google, the company said.</p> ]]></description>

SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement on Wednesday that the approvals were not an endorsement of bitcoin, calling it a “speculative, volatile asset”.</p><p>The ETF launches lifted the price of bitcoin up to its highest level since December 2021. It was last up 0.77 per cent at US$46,303, while the price of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 2.79 per cent at US$2597.95.</p><h3>RACE FOR MARKET SHARE</h3><p>The regulatory nod sparked intense competition for market share among the issuers, some of whom slashed the fees for their products well below the US ETF industry’s standard even before Thursday’s launch.</p><p>Fees on the new bitcoin ETFs range from 0.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, with many firms also offering to waive fees entirely for a certain period or for a certain dollar volume of assets. After its ETF started trading, Valkyrie cut its fees a second time to 0.25 per cent and waived them for the first three months.</p><p>Grayscale was approved to convert its existing bitcoin trust into an ETF on Thursday, overnight creating the world’s largest bitcoin ETF with more than US$28 billion in assets under management.</p><p>Estimates for how much spot bitcoin ETFs could reel in vary widely. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that flows will build up gradually to cross US$10 billion in 2024, while Standard Chartered analysts this week said the ETFs could draw US$50 billion to US$100 billion this year alone. Other analysts have said inflows could be US$55 billion over five years.</p><p>As the ETFs began trading on Thursday, market participants were closely watching bid-ask spreads: the difference between the price for a trader to buy into an ETF and the price it can be sold. ETFs with narrower spreads are typically viewed as more desirable.</p><p>Trading volume, internal plumbing and the number of participants involved “are critically important to driving the spreads to a good spot”, said Jason Stoneberg, director of product strategy at Invesco, whose ETF with Galaxy Digital debuted on Thursday.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">

</div>
</div><p>Some analysts cautioned that the euphoria around the approval might be premature. The broader investment community still views cryptocurrencies as risky, with scandals such as the implosion of crypto exchange FTX in 2022 adding to investors’ wariness.</p><p>A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm had no plans to launch its own crypto investment products, and that its focus remains on core asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash, which it views “as the blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio”.</p><p>Speaking at a webinar on Thursday, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, head of the Investment Strategy Group and chief investment officer of wealth management at Goldman Sachs, said cryptocurrencies had no place in an investment portfolio.</p><p>“When you think about it, where is there any value to something like bitcoin?” she said. “We don’t think it is an asset class to invest in.”</p><h3>CRYPTO STOCKS GAIN</h3><p>Still, some expect the products to pave the way for even more innovative crypto ETFs, including spot ether products.</p><p>Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Thursday that the firm plans to file for a covered call ETF in an effort to allow investors to generate income from options on its spot bitcoin product.</p><p>Cryptocurrency-related stocks initially climbed higher on Thursday, but ended the day lower, with bitcoin miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital dropping 15.8 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively.</p><p>Bitcoin investor Microstrategy fell 5.2 per cent and crypto exchange Coinbase 6.7 per cent. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which tracks bitcoin futures, gained 0.44 per cent.</p><p>Also on Thursday, Circle Internet Financial, the company behind stablecoin USDC, said it had confidentially filed for a US initial public offering.

<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English Summary：</h2>  In the wake of Chinese pressure, ASML's top lobbyist in the EU, Wouter Baljon, criticizes the European Union's handling of economic security. He believes that the EU should aim to be in the "Champions League" of economic security, but its performance is currently at the "Europa League" level, lagging behind countries like the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. He is concerned about the EU's overreliance on export controls as an instrument for addressing concerns about China's industrial progress and the risk this poses to European competitiveness.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: EU criticized for its economic security approach and its overreliance on export controls in managing relations with China.</li>    <li>Theme: A critical assessment of the EU's economic security policies by a leading Dutch technology company.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: ASML's viewpoint is that the EU needs to step up its economic security game and avoid overly restrictive measures that harm European competitiveness.</li>    <li>Main Information: ASML's criticism of the EU's economic security approach; concerns about the impact of export controls on the European tech industry; the need for a more balanced and comprehensive strategy.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>中文总结：</h2>  因中国施压，ASML欧盟首席说客沃特·巴尔扬批评欧盟处理经济安全的方式。他认为，欧盟应争取进入经济安全的“冠军联赛”，但目前仅达到“欧罗巴联赛”水准，落后于美国、中国、日本、韩国和台湾等国家。他担忧欧盟过度依赖出口管制，以此作为应对中国工业进步担忧的手段，并认为这将危及欧洲竞争力。  <ul>    <li>摘要：欧盟因处理经济安全和管理对华关系时过度依赖出口管制而受到批评。</li>    <li>主题：荷兰领先科技公司对欧盟经济安全政策的严厉评估。</li>    <li>观点：ASML认为欧盟需要提升经济安全水平，避免损害欧洲竞争力的过度限制性措施。</li>    <li>主要信息：ASML对欧盟经济安全政策的批评；对出口管制影响欧洲科技产业的担忧；欧盟有必要采取更均衡、全面的策略。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>Geopolitical - (adj.) 地缘政治的，地缘战略的    <p>原文例句：Its executives should have a good idea of who’s who in the pantheon of geopolitical arm-twisting, having been caught in the cross hairs of a fierce US-China tech war.</p>    <p>例句讲解：Geopolitical一词由geo-（地球）和political（政治）组成，表示与地理和政治相关的事物。在这个例句中，它被用来描述美国和中国之间的激烈技术战争的背景，其中ASML公司因其在全球芯片制造业中的重要地位而受到影响。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>litigation (n.) - /ˌlɪtɪˈgeɪʃən/ 诉讼，法律诉讼。    <p>原文例句：The Russian businessman has been locked in a legal tussle with the sanctioned lender since litigation began in early 2019.</p>    <p>例句讲解：litigation由litigate（诉讼）和-ion（事物，过程）组成，表示法律诉讼或争端。在这个例句中，它指的是俄罗斯商人自2019年初开始与受制裁的贷款人之间的法律纠纷。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>cross hairs - 十字准线，瞄准线。    <p>原文例句：Its executives should have a good idea of who’s who in the pantheon of geopolitical arm-twisting, having been caught in the cross hairs of a fierce US-China tech war.</p>    <p>例句讲解：cross hairs是一个军事术语，指的是瞄准镜或枪支上用来瞄准目标的十字准线。在这个例句中，它比喻ASML公司因其在全球芯片制造业中的重要地位而受到美国和中国两国的高度关注，就像被十字准线瞄准一样。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>economic security - 经济安全    <p>原文例句：The European Union is not in the “Champions League of economic security”, and even “struggles to perform at Europa League level”.That was the withering assessment of a senior representative of ASML, Europe’s most valuable technology company, who used a football analogy to attack Brussels’ efforts to de-risk its relations with China.</p>    <p>例句讲解：economic security是一个经济学术语，指的是一个国家或地区能够保障其经济利益和持续发展不受外部因素干扰和破坏的能力。在这个例句中，它指的是欧盟在经济安全领域的表现被认为不如美国、中国、日本等国家，甚至连韩国和台湾也无法相比。</p></li>  </ul>  </div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>The American policy was “all about curtailing the ability of China to make industrial progress”, Baljon said, adding that the EU was living in “la-la land” if it thought otherwise. - 巴尔扬说，美国的政策“完全是为了限制中国取得工业进步”，他补充说，如果欧盟认为不是这样，那它就生活在“梦幻世界”里。<p>句子分析：这是一个长句，主句是American policy was 是什么，其中主语是American policy，谓语是was，宾语是all about curtailing the ability of China to make industrial progress。添加的部分是Baljon说和如果欧盟认为不是这样，那它就生活在“梦幻世界”里。这两个部分都是句子的一部分，其中Baljon说是一个独立分句，起着强调的作用；而如果欧盟认为不是这样，那它就生活在“梦幻世界”里是一个条件状语从句，对主句起着限制和说明的作用。这个句子的意思是说，巴尔扬说，美国的政策“完全是为了限制中国取得工业进步”，他补充说，如果欧盟认为不是这样，那它就生活在“梦幻世界”里。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>should have - 助动词，表示应该，应当。    <p>原文例句：Its executives should have a good idea of who’s who in the pantheon of geopolitical arm-twisting, having been caught in the cross hairs of a fierce US-China tech war.</p>    <p>语法讲解：should have是一个助动词，用来表示应该，应当，或义务。它通常与have一起使用，构成should have + 宾语结构。在这个例句中，should have表示ASML的高管们应该对地缘政治领域的谁是谁有很好的了解。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>being caught in the cross hairs - 陷入十字准线，处于不利境地。    <p>原文例句：Its executives should have a good idea of who’s who in the pantheon of geopolitical arm-twisting, having been caught in the cross hairs of a fierce US-China tech war.</p>    <p>语法讲解：being caught in the cross hairs是一个介词短语，意为陷入十字准线，处于不利境地。它通常用作比喻，表示陷入激烈的竞争或冲突中。在这个例句中，it表示ASML公司。这个介词短语是对ASML公司在中美科技战中所处困境的形象描述。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant among several business groups on continent critical of Brussels’ efforts to de-risk its relations with Beijing</li>

</div><p>“The EU clearly … aspires to be in the Champions League, but for high technology, they struggled to perform at Europa League-level,” said Baljon at an event in Brussels on Wednesday, referring to the continent’s inferior competition.</p><p>ASML, valued at US$285 billion, is the world leader in the chipmaking equipment essential for manufacturing advanced <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/semiconductors" target="_self" title="">semiconductors</a> and considered the crown jewel in Europe’s tech sector.</p><p>Its executives should have a good idea of who’s who in the pantheon of geopolitical arm-twisting, having been caught in the cross hairs of a fierce <a href="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/us-china-tech-war-rivalry/news" target="_self" title="">US-China tech war</a>.</p><p>ASML has been forced to stop selling some advanced precision lithography machines to Chinese buyers at the behest of the Biden administration.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3247042/chip-industry-giant-asml-blocked-us-netherlands-shipping-equipment-china-ahead-export-deadline" title="">ASML blocked from shipping chip-making equipment to China ahead of deadline</a></h3><p>The American policy was “all about curtailing the ability of China to make industrial progress”, Baljon said, adding that the EU was living in “la-la land” if it thought otherwise.</p><p>“We haven’t acknowledged that export controls have become an industrial policy instrument.

As the EU 27, we are a challenger, and we need the instruments and the approaches to reflect this.”</p><p>“We might speak of the ‘geopolitical commission’, but at this point, I think it’s only as geopolitical as [the] Franco-German axis allows it to be, and you also don’t have the manpower to really be in this Champions League.”</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3246046/chinas-imports-dutch-chip-making-equipment-surged-tenfold-november-after-washington-tightened" title="">China’s imports of Dutch chip-making equipment surged tenfold in November</a></h3><p>The EU will present an “initiative” on screening outbound investments and a proposal on export controls for four crucial technologies, including microchips, on January 24. These form part of a package of tools aimed at de-risking its trading ties with China.</p><p>Baljon’s remarks were among a series of broadsides voiced at the event as businesses lined up to criticise the EU’s plans.</p><p>Malte Lohan, director general of Orgalim, a trade association representing Europe’s tech industries, said firms in his sector were facing “a tsunami of regulation”.</p><p>“You can’t just regulate your way to economic security from a few office blocks in Brussels,” Lohan said, adding he was “very nervous” about an “unprecedented shift to public intervention in our supply chains”.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3244922/eu-china-relations-amid-brussels-de-risk-plans-european-firms-are-reluctant-speak-china" title="">EU firms are reluctant to speak up on China as Brussels tries to de-risk</a></h3><p>“If you look at any one of the instruments in isolation, of course there’s always a very good reason for it … I think we need to accept that this is a completely new paradigm in terms of how supply chains are regulated through public-sector intervention.”</p><p>Luisa Santos, deputy director general at BusinessEurope, another lobby group, said the EU endangered its competitiveness by putting security concerns ahead of economic growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine-war" target="_self" title="">war</a> in <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/ukraine" target="_self" title="">Ukraine</a> had “created a new consensus in the business community” on the security issues Europe faces, she said.</p><p>“But we should not overdo it also, because we have other problems that we need to deal with and we have not dealt with yet, including our competitiveness … what we have seen in these last years is that compared to other partners in terms of overall competitiveness … we [in Europe] are not in such good shape.”</p> ]]></description>

While the new device uses a mid-tier <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/qualcomm" target="_self" title="">Qualcomm</a> processor, Realme said it collaborated with the US chip design firm on a solution to improve image-processing speed.</p><p>The 11 Pro+ smartphone launched by Realme last year costs 2,799 yuan, or about US$400.</p><p>At its event, Realme said the firm’s slogan, “Dare to leap”, has been changed to “Make it real” as part of a rebranding effort.</p><p>The company said it was focused on a niche market segment, where it has found success overseas at a time when global smartphone sales are slumping and China’s post-pandemic <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/chinas-economic-recovery" target="_self" title="">economic recovery</a> has sputtered.</p><p>Realme acknowledged challenges from the pandemic, component shortages and longer replacement cycles from consumers, but the firm also touted its sales numbers – more than <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3242898/chinas-realme-sister-brand-vivo-oppo-surges-past-200-million-smartphone-shipments" target="_self" title="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3242898/chinas-realme-sister-brand-vivo-oppo-surges-past-200-million-smartphone-shipments">200 million handsets sold</a> since its incubation at Oppo – as “giving us confidence that we’re on to something”.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3242898/chinas-realme-sister-brand-vivo-oppo-surges-past-200-million-smartphone-shipments" title="">China’s Realme surges past 200 million smartphone shipments</a></h3><p>Moving forward, Realme aims to double down on what it believes young users want most in a smartphone. The answer it came up with is better photos when zooming in. So the firm has combined a half-inch sensor with a 3x optical zoom periscope lens and built that in its mid-tier line of smartphones.</p><p>It also collaborated with watch designer Ollivier Savéo, who previously worked at Rolex and Piaget, among others, on a design evocative of famed Swiss watches.</p><p>At a time of rising scrutiny of all things Chinese, Realme made its latest product announcement in a country leading the charge against tech from China and where the company does not even sell smartphones.</p><p>For all the other missing Chinese brands – and the smattering of journalists and influencers who showed up to cover the Realme event – it may as well have been part of the show. Vivo and Oppo, two of China’s biggest smartphone brands, were nowhere to be found in Las Vegas, even though Realme spun out of Oppo. OnePlus, the Oppo-owned brand, had suites booked for private showings, but also had no presence on the CES exhibition floor.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247657/ces-2024-chinese-tech-giants-alibaba-bytedance-lead-chinas-return-premier-consumer-electronics-show" title="">Tech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China’s return to CES</a></h3><p>Neither <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi" target="_self" title="">Xiaomi</a> nor <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3012321/huawei-among-more-140-chinese-entities-us-trade-blacklist" target="_self" title="">US-blacklisted</a> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei/news" target="_self" title="">Huawei Technologies</a> were at CES.</p><p>Realme said it did not exhibit at CES because the 12 Pro+ handset has not officially launched yet. It organised a pre-briefing in Las Vegas because many of its contacts across a variety of markets would be in town for the world’s largest consumer electronics show.</p><p>While the company set a goal last year of selling in more than 100 markets over the next five years, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states" target="_self" title="">United States</a> is one market where it may not expand owing to the complexities of getting domestic network carrier support.</p><p>The bulk of US handset sales still happen through mobile network operators, forcing smartphone brands to strike deals to find success. OnePlus has struggled with this situation, despite the glowing reviews received by many of its devices from US tech media.</p><p>Realme said it was still trying to cooperate with a US carrier to get into the market, where 87 per cent of teenagers own an iPhone, according to a survey by investment bank Piper Sandler.</p><p>Meanwhile, Realme has been selling in parts of Europe and Latin America, which it described as an important market for the company’s upcoming 12-series handsets.</p> ]]></description>

Nvidia added Drive Thor – which integrates automated and assisted driving, in-vehicle infotainment, and parking in one single system – to its family of automotive system-on-a-chip solutions in September 2022.</p><p>As of June last year, Nvidia – which is unable to ship its advanced AI chips to China due to US trade sanctions – had about a 52 per cent share of the global navigate-on-autopilot (NOA) market and cooperation agreements with 25 automotive original equipment makers globally, according to data from Gasgoo Institute, a Shanghai-based research company.</p><p>“Nvidia remains predominant in terms of smart-driving chips in China,” said Brady Wang, an associate director with research firm Counterpoint. “But competition between Chinese manufacturers and foreign companies is set to intensify as they compete for a slice of the autonomous driving segment in China’s EV market.”</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3245507/chinese-non-tech-firms-have-also-been-scrambling-buy-nvidia-gpus-landscape-designer-reveals-order" title="">Non-tech Chinese firms tout orders of Nvidia chips, winning stock boosts</a></h3><p>Chinese EV makers have been big buyers of Nvidia auto chips. For example, Nio’s flagship sedans ET5 and ES7, Li Auto’s L9 model and Xpeng’s G9 vehicle all come equipped with Nvidia’s Orin chips. Automotive chips are seen as a less sensitive area of the semiconductor market by US authorities when it comes to setting trade sanctions.</p><p>In 2022, China sold about 7 million units of smart passenger vehicles equipped with assisted autonomous driving systems, which translates into a market penetration rate of 35 per cent.

Huawei and MobileEye ranked in equal 4th place with a 4 per cent market share each.</p><p>Huawei has emerged as a leading player due to its experience in auto chip design and hardware systems after it set up a smart car solution unit in 2019, the year it was added to a US trade blacklist. Under these sanctions, Huawei could not buy most US-origin semiconductors and had to rely on its own smart-driving chips.</p><p>Priot to the 2023 Shanghai Auto Show in April, Huawei launched its own home-grown smart driving platform, called advanced driving system 2.0 (ADS) and powered by a Huawei-made chipset MDC 610, according to a report by research company Counterpoint and a note in July by Kaiyuan Securities.</p><p>In November, Huawei announced it was transferring core technologies from its smart car business into a new joint venture with state-backed Changan Automobile.
