But at the end of the day, when we achieve 100 per cent electric cars, there will be very tiny amounts of new critical materials to be mined.”</p><p>China leads the world in battery recycling technologies, an important solution for addressing battery material shortages.</p><p>For instance, Zeng told the forum that CATL currently has the capacity to recycle as much as 99.6 per cent of precious metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese, and up to 91 per cent of lithium, higher than Europe’s capacity of 70 per cent to 80 per cent. Last year, CATL recycled 100,000 tonnes of waste batteries through its subsidiary Brump to create 13,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate, he said.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3244015/chinese-ev-battery-giant-catl-will-set-research-and-development-centre-hong-kong-win-government" title="">EV battery giant CATL to open research and development centre in Hong Kong</a></h3><p>But CATL’s business has been affected by the fraught relations between Beijing and the West. In December, for instance, CATL was accused of posing a national security threat in the US and was banned from a US military base. The allegation was based on a letter from US lawmakers led by Republican senator Marco Rubio that said CATL enjoyed a close relationship with the Chinese leadership in Beijing.</p><p>“We are fighting climate change … so whatever the geopolitical issues are, we have to find a way,” Zeng said during the panel.</p><p>As sales of EVs continue to break records around the world, governments and carmakers are increasingly concerned about the persistent shortages of lithium, nickel and cobalt, which could put the net-zero transition under threat.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3231316/catl-produce-worlds-fastest-ev-battery-offers-400km-driving-range-just-10-minutes-charging-keep" title="">CATL to make battery offering 400km driving range from 10-minute charge</a></h3><p>S&amp;P Global forecast that a more than 270 per cent increase in lithium production levels is needed to meet the estimated demand from the EV battery sector by 2030. Nickel and cobalt are also expected to be critical, but to a lesser degree as the deployment of iron-based chemistries will remedy their potential shortage, it said.</p><p>The Fujian-based company is willing to share its technologies and help overseas carmakers address their battery shortages, Zeng said.

Over 1,000 companies were <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3248469/alibaba-tiktok-woo-us-ai-and-live-streaming-e-commerce-ces-trade-show-setting-tone-2024" target="_self" title="">from China</a>, demonstrating the country’s impressive contributions to global technology.</p><p>In particular spotlight was China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry, after China was recently crowned the world’s <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3247833/china-solidify-its-position-worlds-top-car-exporter-2024-it-banks-manufacturing-heft-ubs" target="_self" title="">largest car exporter</a>, accounting for about half of global EV sales. At the tech showcase, Xpeng astonished with its <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247942/ces-2024-china-ev-maker-xpeng-accepts-pre-orders-flying-car-notes-urban-use-far" target="_self" title="">“flying car”</a>, the AeroHT eVTOL.</p><p>Built sleekly in the shape of a sports car, with propellers that unfurl, the futuristic vehicle evoked visions of flying vehicles seen in films such as <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>The Fifth Element</em>. The model, thought to be years away from broad use, completed a successful test flight in October 2022.</p><p>At CES, Xpeng also showcased its <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247942/ces-2024-china-ev-maker-xpeng-accepts-pre-orders-flying-car-notes-urban-use-far" target="_self" title="">Land Aircraft Carrier</a>, which comes with a separate aircraft that launches from the car, for which the company will take pre-orders in the fourth quarter this year, with deliveries to start a year later.</p><p>The Chinese government is keen for companies to continue making leaps in flying vehicle technology and last year announced a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3237594/china-outlines-vision-green-aviation-nev-industry-c919-models" target="_self" title="">“green aviation” development plan</a>, including for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, or eVTOL. This is part of an official strategy to support a “<a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3245769/chinas-low-altitude-economy-set-take-vast-potential-could-contribute-us700-billion-2025" target="_self" title="">low altitude economy</a>”.</p><p>The low-altitude economy refers to a comprehensive realm of industries centred around civil-manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, including manufacturing, low-altitude flight operations and integrated services.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="Xpeng launched its modular Land Aircraft Carrier, which comes with a separate aircraft that launches from the car.

Photo: Handout</figcaption></figure></div><p>China’s green aviation plan presented actionable items to boost the innovation and deployment of flying cars. Important measures include setting up economic demonstration zones and test bases for low-flying aircraft. The plan includes the construction of infrastructure to integrate flying vehicles into urban transport and the daily commute.</p><p>While US flying car companies such as Kittyhawk (backed by Google founder Larry Page) shut down in 2022 due to commercialising and scaling difficulties, China’s policy support is fostering a more conducive ecosystem for nascent technologies like this to advance and benefit society.</p><p>Xpeng’s AeroHT eVTOL, for instance, unlike other flying vehicles such as by German company Volocopter and Hyundai’s Supernal, which was showcased at CES 2024, can transform between terrestrial and aerial modes.</p><p>While the inventions by Volocopter and Supernal resemble personal helicopters, Xpeng’s AeroHT eVTOL has propellers that emerge in flying mode and fold into the car’s body after use. This allows it to navigate road traffic and fit into a standard car park space.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="People view the XPeng AeroHT “modular flying car” at the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 11.

Photo: AFP</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another factor that enhances the research and development of flying cars in China is close public-private collaboration. For instance, in 2021, the Guangdong government <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3125538/china-electric-cars-xpeng-receives-us77-million-investment" target="_self" title="">invested 500 million yuan</a> (US$70 million) in Xpeng. Guangdong’s Zhaoqing city has also supported Xpeng’s expansion, last year signing an investment agreement for a project worth 2 billion yuan. This type of financial and infrastructural support creates a nurturing ecosystem that enables Chinese EV makers to quickly transform concept cars into mass products.</p><p>China has highlighted the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3245769/chinas-low-altitude-economy-set-take-vast-potential-could-contribute-us700-billion-2025" target="_self" title="">low-altitude economy</a> as a core industry, deserving of special attention, at its annual <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3244856/chinas-development-biggest-political-priority-key-econ-meeting-leaders-vow-counter-risks-lift" target="_self" title="">central economic work conference</a> last month, together with artificial intelligence, the digital economy, green energy, biomedicine and private space flight. The vision is for China to address its economic challenges by investing in technology and industry, unlocking the country’s growth potential.</p><p>In addition to flying cars, drones are another area of China’s low-altitude economy that promises to revolutionise its agriculture, delivery services, emergency responses and more. Already, Shenzhen, China’s hi-tech hub, has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3246693/chinas-low-altitude-economy-takes-skies-unmanned-passenger-drone-completes-maiden-commercial-flight" target="_self" title="">declared plans</a> to build itself a “city in the sky”.</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/2184687/how-dji-went-university-dorm-project-worlds-biggest-drone-company" target="_self" title="">China’s DJI</a> is the world’s largest drone manufacturer with 70 per cent of the global market share. Its drone technology has helped in the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/2183603/drone-maker-dji-eyes-enterprise-business-transformation-hardware-maker" target="_self" title="">automation of farming</a>, including planning, sowing, weeding, watering and monitoring crop growth. Food delivery platform Meituan, for example, has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3224049/how-chinese-tech-giant-meituan-cracked-food-delivery-drone-densely-built-shenzhen-and-implications" target="_self" title="">embraced drones</a>, speeding up its commercial transactions and slashing its labour cost. In 2022, the drone industry in Shenzhen alone generated a market value of 75 billion yuan.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>Shenzhen is building a grid of over 600 landing/take-off stations for low-altitude aircraft from by 2025. This will facilitate their deployment and reduce operational costs for companies. Infrastructural support is essential in this industry, especially when the aim is to promote widespread public usage.</p><p>With more companies developing flying cars and other low-altitude aircraft in China, industry regulation is also maturing. This year, Shenzhen announced China’s first regulations over the low-altitude economy. Effective from February 1, these regulations aim to standardise the construction of low-altitude flight infrastructure, coordinate the management of low-altitude airspace and flight services, and set safety standards.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/3227433/rise-shenzhen-chinas-silicon-valley-seaside-town-fast-moving-city-secret-pockets-tranquillity" title="">The rise of Shenzhen, from seaside town to China’s Silicon Valley</a></h3><p>They stipulate the construction of a low-altitude flight service platform, providing services like flight approval applications, intelligent flight monitoring and message alerts to units or individuals conducting low-altitude flight activities.</p><p>The fierce market competition in China’s EV industry has certainly contributed to the industry’s exponential growth. But China’s institutional support also plays a role in quickly making hi-tech advancements accessible to ordinary citizens, and not just a few privileged individuals.</p><p>Although there are still gaps between the big cities and the underdeveloped areas, China’s policy principle that new technologies should improve people’s lives and livelihoods makes for a promising future.</p><p>The development of China’s low-altitude economy could serve as an inspirational model for the world, showing the potential for the integration of advanced aerial technologies into everyday life and urban planning.</p><p><strong>Gerui Wang is a visiting scholar at Stanford University</strong></p> ]]></description>

Photo: Getty Images via AFP</figcaption></figure></div><p>Bing has long struggled for relevance and attracted more mockery than recognition over the years as a serious alternative to Google. Multiple rebrandings and redesigns since its 2009 debut did little to boost Bing’s popularity.</p><p>A month before Microsoft infused the search engine with generative AI, people were spending 33 per cent less time using it than they had 12 months earlier, according to SensorTower.</p><p>The ChatGPT reboot at least helped reverse those declines. In the second quarter of 2023, US monthly active users more than doubled year over year to 3.1 million, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of SensorTower mobile app data.</p><p>Overall, users were spending 84 per cent more time on the search engine, the data show. By year-end, Bing’s monthly active users had increased steadily to 4.4 million, according to SensorTower.</p><p>To build on the momentum, Microsoft has been adding more AI tools to Bing. In October, the company integrated the latest version of OpenAI’s image-generating model, DALL-E 3. Visitors can use it to create realistic-looking images with simple text prompts.</p><p>The offering does nothing to enhance Bing’s search abilities. But its addition generated a spike in usage, according to Jordi Ribas, Microsoft’s corporate vice-president of search and AI.</p><p>“We noticed an increase in usage by 10 times and that took us by surprise because if you think about it, DALL-E 2 was already quite good,” he said in an interview. “It really made a difference in the engagement and the users that came to our product.”</p><p>Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer, declined to specify how many active users Bing has.</p><p>“Look, it’s still early days and new behaviours are being built,” he said. “We’re still learning new things, but have millions and millions of people using the new tools.”</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks onstage during a company event in May.

Photo: AFP/Getty Images/TNS</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even as the Bing team adds crowd-pleasers, Google has been racing to develop its own AI tools.</p><p>In May, it launched an experimental version of its search engine called the “search generative experience”, which delivers conversational responses atop the familiar list of links. Dubbed SGE for short, it is still not widely available. However, Google plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into SGE sometime this year.</p><p>The Alphabet division also retains considerable advantages. It has more than 90 per cent of the market and is the default search engine on Apple hardware, including iPhones, giving Google crucial critical mass. The more people who use it, the more the search engine knows and the more Google can use that data to deliver and rank results in a way people find useful.</p><p>The retooling of search by both technology giants reflects a shared conviction that generative AI will fundamentally change the way people seek and receive answers online.</p><p>For Microsoft, the shift is an opportunity to propel Bing forward. But the incremental gains so far make clear that buzzy AI features alone probably will not transform it into a formidable search player.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>“We are at the gold rush moment when it comes to AI and search,” said Shane Greenstein, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, who has studied the commercialisation of the internet.</p><p>“At the moment, I doubt AI will move the needle because, in search, you need a flywheel: the more searches you have, the better answers are. Google is the only firm who has this dynamic well-established.”</p><p>Still, Greenstein said Bing, being the underdog, has more latitude to experiment. “Google has to be careful not to hurt its brand and product when it comes to testing new AI tools,” he said. “Bing can afford to take the risk. It has nothing to lose.”</p><p>Microsoft is also betting that generative AI will change how advertisers allocate their search spending. The current ad model rests on costs-per-click, but AI-powered searches are getting consumers to answers faster and more directly without a litany of blue links, according to marketing chief Mehdi.</p><p>“We have advertisers telling us they’re getting better outcomes as a result of our AI efforts and are deeply interested in how this works,” he said.</p> ]]></description>

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p><strong>This article was first published by The Korea Times in a partnership with the South China Morning Post.</strong></p><p>A resident of eastern Jiangsu province, 48-year-old Shen Ling used to own a number of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/samsung-electronics" target="_self" title="">Samsung Electronics</a> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/smartphones" target="_self" title="">smartphones</a> in the 2010s, attracted by the devices’ well-designed appearance and popularity among consumers across mainland China.</p><p>“It was once an age of glory for Samsung in China, when so many of my friends were using the brand for its high-end market standing,” Shen said. “I also chose to buy a Samsung phone at that time for the same reason.”</p><p>But Samsung’s strong run in the world’s largest smartphone market took a disastrous turn in late 2016, when the company <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/enterprises/article/2027114/samsung-permanently-shuts-note-7-production" target="_self" title="">permanently halted production of its Galaxy Note 7 handset</a> amid increased concerns about the device catching fire. That followed widespread criticism from Chinese consumers after <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2023711/samsung-insists-note-7-china-safe-after-6th-reported-battery-explosion" target="_self" title="">several incidents where the handset’s battery exploded</a>. In January 2017, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/south-korea" target="_self" title="">South Korean</a> electronics giant admitted that those incidents were <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2064560/samsungs-galaxy-note-7-fires-caused-battery-design-manufacturing-issues" target="_self" title="">caused by battery manufacturing and design issues</a> after an internal investigation.</p><p>“The harm to Samsung’s image was devastating,” Shen said. “It made me unsure if I could trust the quality of its future handsets.” Shen finally decided to switch to a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei/news" target="_self" title="">Huawei Technologies</a> smartphone in 2020.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="A Hong Kong-based Galaxy Note 7 smartphone user claimed in this Facebook post on September 19, 2016, that the device’s battery exploded when it was being charged.

The Korean firm ranked dead last among the market’s major handset vendors by 2018, with just a 1 per cent share and has since remained around that level.</p><p>The company’s fall in mainland China’s smartphone market was partly due to “a combination of inappropriate operations leading to a damaged reputation”, said Ivan Lam, a senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. He also indicated that major Chinese vendors – including Huawei, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/xiaomi" target="_self" title="">Xiaomi</a>, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/oppo" target="_self" title="">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/vivo" target="_self" title="">Vivo</a> – rose to become strong domestic and international competitors.</p><p>But Samsung, which was unseated by <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/apple" target="_self" title="">Apple</a> in terms of annual smartphone shipments worldwide <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3248666/apple-gets-deeper-chinas-smartphone-price-wars-widening-iphone-discounts-rival-huawei-stays-above?utm_source=rss_feed" target="_self" title="">for the first time in 2023</a>, still has ambitions to return to its former glory on the mainland.</p><p>While Huawei has largely retreated from the Korean market primarily because of local consumers’ loyalty to homegrown Android handsets, Samsung is slowly trying to stage a comeback in China. Still, Samsung’s mission has become more difficult amid the mainland’s <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3248694/china-gdp-beijings-long-do-list-boost-economy-2024" target="_self" title="">shaky post-pandemic economic recovery</a>.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>“Samsung has shifted its focus to the high-end market in China, particularly with the introduction of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/foldable-phones" target="_self" title="">foldable models</a>,” Counterpoint’s Lam said. “The current strategy for Samsung in China appears to be characterised by conservatism, stability and continuity.”</p><p>Over the past few years, Samsung continued to launch new smartphone models on the mainland. It has also been working with some Chinese Big Tech companies, including <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/baidu" target="_self" title="">Baidu</a> and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/tencent" target="_self" title="">Tencent Holdings</a>, to help step up localisation of its smartphones’ content ecosystem.</p><p>The reason Samsung did not fully leave mainland China was obvious: the country remains the world’s largest computing, smartphone, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/internet?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article" target="_self" title="">internet</a> and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/semiconductors" target="_self" title="">semiconductor</a> market. Continued operation in the vast market has become more important for the Korean conglomerate, as its sales have been hit hard by sluggish global consumer electronics demand.</p><p>In its earnings guidance released last week, Samsung said it expected to post its <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247740/samsung-profit-tumbles-35-chip-weakness-persists" target="_self" title="">sixth straight quarter of declining operating profit</a>. The company estimated that its operating earnings for 2023 plunged 84.9 per cent year on year to 6.54 trillion won (US$4.86 billion), while annual revenue was expected to drop 14.6 per cent to 258.16 trillion won.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247740/samsung-profit-tumbles-35-chip-weakness-persists" title="">Samsung profit tumbles 35% as chip weakness persists</a></h3><p>Samsung’s sharpened focus on the premium segment of China’s smartphone market has managed to attract a growing number of new users. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/shanghai" target="_self" title="">Shanghai</a> university student Cynthia Xia, for example, started using Samsung’s foldable <a href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/gadgets/article/3192963/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-vs-motorola-razr-foldable-smartphones" target="_self" title="">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a> smartphone in 2022.</p><p>“I was totally attracted by the design and its flexibility to adopt customised settings,” Xia said. “I think no other brands are doing as well as Samsung in foldable phones.”</p><p>Still, Samsung’s outlook in the world’s second-largest economy is complicated by the ongoing <a href="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/us-china-tech-war-rivalry/news" target="_self" title="">US-China tech war</a>, which has cast a shadow over the Korean firm’s supply chain network on the mainland.</p><p>Although Samsung, along with memory chip rival <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3218776/south-korean-chip-maker-sk-hynix-denies-reports-it-selling-firms-dalian-flash-memory-fab-assuring" target="_self" title="">SK Hynix</a>, last year secured indefinite waivers from Washington to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3237485/tech-war-us-waiver-china-export-restrictions-advanced-semiconductor-equipment-south-koreas-samsung" target="_self" title="">ship advanced semiconductor-manufacturing equipment</a> for their China plants, the tech conglomerate has been downsizing its production facilities and number of employees in the country.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3014564/samsungs-last-china-smartphone-factory-closing-raising" title="">Will closing last Samsung smartphone factory hurt China’s role in global value chain?</a></h3><p>Over the past several years, Samsung has shut down multiple production bases on the mainland, including <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3014564/samsungs-last-china-smartphone-factory-closing-raising" target="_self" title="">its last smartphone plant</a> in Huizhou, a city in southern Guangdong province, and last personal computer factory in Suzhou, a bustling metropolis in Jiangsu. The company had 17,891 employees on the mainland in 2022, which was in stark contrast to its peak of 63,316 in 2013, according to Samsung’s Sustainability Report.</p><p>The relocation of Samsung’s factories from the mainland showed how the company “strategically deprioritised the Chinese market, resulting in reduced investment in brand and channel building”, Counterpoint’s Lam said.</p><p>With Samsung’s recently launched <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3248863/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-smartphones-come-google-gemini-ai-technology-fight-apple-iphones" target="_self" title="">Galaxy 24 series, which features artificial intelligence technology</a>, all eyes are on how the company can help revive and bring change to the global smartphone market.</p><p>Still, that new handset is not expected to make a big splash on the mainland.</p><p>“None of my friends are using Samsung’s phones nowadays, so why wouldn’t I stick with domestic brands when they offer similar functionalities at lower prices?” Shen from Jiangsu said.</p> ]]></description>

Since its launch in August 2019, HarmonyOS currently runs on over 800 million devices.</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个时态，结构是：have/has + been + 现在分词。其中have/has要根据主语的人称和数进行变化，been是be的过去分词，现在分词是动词的-ing形式。这种时态表示动作或状态从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在，强调动作或状态的持续性和未完成性。在这个例句中，it has been growing表示HarmonyOS的采用一直在增长，而since its launch in August 2019则表示这一增长是从2019年8月HarmonyOS发布以来开始的。currently runs on over 800 million devices表示HarmonyOS目前在超过8亿台设备上运行，强调这一状态的持续性。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>The developer preview version of HarmonyOS Next was made available to coders on Thursday</li>
