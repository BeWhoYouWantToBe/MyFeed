</div><p>As Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around artificial intelligence tools based on technology from OpenAI, its Office products remain one of the best ways to get customers to pay extra for AI assistance.</p><p>Executives have said demand is unusually high, with Azure chief Scott Guthrie likening it to the queues outside shops to purchase Windows 95 software nearly three decades ago.</p><p>Microsoft has been testing the Office-based copilot, now called Copilot for Microsoft 365, since March. The company began selling it widely in November, as long as companies purchased at least 300 subscriptions. That left out small businesses and those that wanted to begin with a smaller trial, said Jared Spataro, a Microsoft vice-president, in an interview.</p><p>“We have just never seen demand in the commercial space for a product like we are seeing for Copilot from Microsoft 365,’’ he said. “We have had pressure I have never seen from small and medium businesses saying ‘why will you not let us buy this? Let us try it’.”</p><p>Microsoft announced the new services ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, which will be attended by chief executive officer Satya Nadella.</p><p>Microsoft’s consumer service, called Copilot Pro, offers similar features to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3235800/openai-updates-chatgpt-ability-hear-and-speak-see-images-it-still-cannot-sing" target="_self" title="">OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus</a> at the same price, though the integration with Office differentiates their product, Spataro said.</p><p>The company plans to roll out a builder tool, similar to what OpenAI unveiled last year, that will let individuals create their own Copilots for a specific topic, a service that is already available to enterprises.</p><p>Microsoft’s privacy rules for the consumer version also differ from the business one. Unlike data from corporate customers, Microsoft said it will retain a portion of prompts and responses from the consumer model to retrain models and improve the product.</p> ]]></description>

<title>Apple’s China price cuts on iPhones, MacBooks ‘cancel out’ pressure from rivals chasing premium segment, say analysts</title>

<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English summary:</h2>  Apple offers Chinese consumers discounts of up to $113 on some of its products in response to increasing competition from local rivals, particularly Huawei. The discounts apply to a range of items, including iPhones, iPads, MacBook Airs, Apple Watches, and AirPods, and will be available until the end of the coming weekend.

A representative from the largest electronics retail chain in the US told Invisible Tech that it had not seen other products like its cabinet with an embedded speaker in the base, according to the start-up’s co-founder Patrick Lee.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="Invisible &amp; Innovation Technology makes cabinets with embedded speakers, which are partially made of recycled materials.

Henry Cheung, the company’s other co-founder, said the company wants to “help Hong Kong fulfil its carbon neutral mission”. The city aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.</p><p>The Hong Kong pavilion at this year’s CES, which concluded on Friday, featured a variety of start-ups that make products ranging from the quirky to the practical.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3247942/ces-2024-china-ev-maker-xpeng-accepts-pre-orders-flying-car-notes-urban-use-far" title="">Chinese EV maker shows off flying car but admits urban use is far off</a></h3><p>XOXO Beverages already has its cocktail-making machine in about 10 bars and restaurants in Hong Kong, but it has not expanded to home use yet. Co-founder Peter Yau said CES was the best show the company has been to.</p><p>“People from all around the world come by and are very interested in the product,” Yau said. “[We got] a lot of contacts, and we’re looking to see what we can do after [the show] with those guys.”</p><p>Two of the participating companies, Sitan Semiconductor International and Raysolve Technology, make micro-LED displays, something that has become more important amid rising interest in augmented reality glasses.</p><p>Sitan was started at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the company said its tech has already found its way into products from big brands like <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/tcl" target="_self" title="https://www.scmp.com/topics/tcl">TCL</a>, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei" target="_self" title="https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/companies/huawei">Huawei Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/topics/oppo" target="_self" title="https://www.scmp.com/topics/oppo">Oppo</a> and Meizu – although not all of these products have been released.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="XOXO Beverages has made a machine that will automatically mix cocktails to specifications inputted through an app. SCMP / Matt Haldane" class="image-inline caption" height="1613" src="https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/15/2b040077-b3ac-4878-bb0e-daa1b2414354_75a0b9ef.jpg" title="XOXO Beverages has made a machine that will automatically mix cocktails to specifications inputted through an app. SCMP / Matt Haldane" width="2000" /><figcaption>XOXO Beverages has made a machine that will automatically mix cocktails to specifications inputted through an app. SCMP / Matt Haldane</figcaption></figure></div><p>For most of the start-ups, though, CES was about getting leads and looking for ways to expand beyond their home market. Getting the attention of a tech giant like Microsoft is one way to achieve that.</p><p>Asked about the prospects of Microsoft investing, AI Guided’s Kong said, “I hope so … I will still have another discussion with them, so we’ll see.”</p><p>This kind of attention also may help the Hong Kong government justify its efforts to turn the city into a tech hub, which has had mixed results in a city better known as a regional financial hub.</p><p>“From a tech area standpoint, I think the opportunity to come to Hong Kong is surging,” said HKSTP’s Yiu. “The number of start-ups that we nurture every year is an increasing trend.”</p> ]]></description>
