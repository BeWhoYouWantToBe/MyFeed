<title>Tech war: Chinese chip-tool giant Naura forecasts surge in 2023 sales on strong local demand amid US export controls</title>

<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English Summary：</h2>  Chinese leading semiconductor equipment manufacturer, Naura Technology Group, predicts a notable increase in both revenue and net profit for 2023. This upsurge is attributed to technological advancements that have strengthened the company's domestic market share. Naura reported a revenue growth projection between 42% and 57%, reaching approximately 20.9 billion yuan to 23.1 billion yuan. This translates to $2.93 billion to $3.24 billion. Furthermore, net profits are anticipated to soar by 57% to 80%, ranging from 3.3 billion yuan to 3.8 billion yuan. Moreover, Naura secured 30 billion yuan worth of new equipment orders last year, primarily in the semiconductor sector.
