<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English summary：</h2>  On Sunday, an explainer article regarding tax on cryptocurrency activities in China was shared widely after it emerged on the Shanghai Municipal Tax Service WeChat account. The article, which was later removed, cited a 2008 statement by the State Taxation Administration (STA) and discussed taxation of income earned from virtual currency transactions. Some crypto enthusiasts interpreted this as a potential easing of the strict cryptocurrency ban imposed by China. However, legal experts clarified that the article does not indicate a policy shift, emphasizing that it merely addressed online payments of video game tokens. This news stirs speculation and debate among the Chinese crypto community and cues a desire for a comprehensive Web3 development plan. Although China remains officially opposed to cryptocurrency, regulatory oversight of虚拟资产related income taxation might grow.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Speculation arises in the Chinese crypto community after Shanghai's tax service article on cryptocurrency taxation, even though China's anti-crypto stance is firm.</li>    <li>Theme: An article posted by Shanghai Municipal Tax Service discussing cryptocurrency transaction taxation prompts speculation of a potential shift in China's cryptocurrency policy.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: Varied interpretations of the article; enthusiasts see easing of crypto ban while experts emphasize its limited scope to video game tokens; speculation in Chinese crypto circles amidst Web3 aspirations.</li>    <li>Main information: Article's removal from Shanghai tax service's WeChat account; clarification by legal experts; discussions of Web3 development plan; China's opposition to cryptocurrencies.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>中文总结：</h2>  周日，一篇有关中国对加密货币活动征税的解释文章在上海市税务局微信公众号发布后被广泛传播。这篇文章后来被删除，引用了国家税务局2008年的一份声明，讨论了从虚拟货币交易中获得的收入的税收问题。一些加密货币爱好者将此解读为对中国实施的严格加密货币禁令的潜在放松。然而，法律专家澄清说，这篇文章并不意味着政策的转变，强调它只是解决了视频游戏代币的在线支付问题。这一消息在中国的加密货币圈内引起了猜测和争论，并暗示了人们希望制定全面的Web3发展计划。虽然中国仍然正式反对加密货币，但对于虚拟资产相关收入征税的监管可能会加强。  <ul>    <li>摘要：尽管中国对加密货币持反对态度，但上海税务局关于加密货币税收的文章引发了中国加密货币社区的猜测。</li>    <li>主题：上海市税务局发布文章讨论加密货币交易税收，引发了中国加密货币政策可能转变的猜测。</li>    <li>观点：文章的不同解读；爱好者认为加密货币禁令有所放松，而专家则强调其范围仅限于视频游戏代币；中国加密货币圈内在Web3愿景的背景下产生猜测。</li>    <li>主要信息：文章从上海税务局微信公众号中删除；法律专家的澄清；关于Web3发展计划的讨论；中国反对加密货币。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>enthus iasts (n.) - /ɪnˈθjuːzɪæst/ 爱好者，狂热者，热衷者。    <p>原文例句：Some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词是由en-（使……成为）和thusia（狂热，热情）构成的，表示“爱好者，狂热者，热衷者”。在这个例句中，它指的是一些当地的加密货币爱好者认为这篇文章承认了加密货币的合法性。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>speculation (n.) - /spekjuˈleɪʃən/  推测，臆测，猜测。    <p>原文例句：The explainer became widely circulated on Sunday after some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，由specere（观察）和-tion（行为，动作）构成的，表示“推测，臆测，猜测，意见”。在这个例句中，它指的是一些当地的加密货币爱好者认为这篇文章承认了加密货币的合法性，引起了广泛的猜测。</p></li>  </ul>    <ul>    <li>rigid (adj.) - /ˈrɪdʒɪd/ 严格的，僵硬的，死板的，不灵活的。    <p>原文例句：China over the years has ramped up its crackdown on all activities related to cryptocurrencies, citing financial stability risks.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，由rigere（僵硬）构成的，表示“严格的，僵硬的，死板的，不灵活的”。在这个例句中，它指的是中国多年来一直加大力度打击所有与加密货币相关的活动，理由是存在金融稳定风险。</p></li>  </ul>  </div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>ramp up (v.) - /ræmp ʌp/ 加强，加大，提高，增加，膨胀。    <p>原文例句：China over the years has ramped up its crackdown on all activities related to cryptocurrencies, citing financial stability risks.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组是由ramp（斜坡，坡道）和up（向上）构成的，表示“加强，加大，提高，增加，膨胀”。在这个例句中，它指的是中国多年来一直加大力度打击所有与加密货币相关的活动。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>The explainer became widely circulated on Sunday after some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy - 这名解释者在一些当地加密货币爱好者建议它承认了加密货币的合法性之后，于周日被广泛传播。<p>句子分析：这是一个复合句，主句是The explainer became widely circulated，其中主语是The explainer，谓语是became widely circulated，宾语是后置宾语after some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy。after some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy是一个过去分词短语作状语，修饰The explainer，表示这一消息是在一些当地加密货币爱好者建议它承认了加密货币的合法性之后。这个句子的意思是说，这一消息在一些当地加密货币爱好者建议它承认了加密货币的合法性之后，于周日被广泛传播。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>现在完成时 - 表示从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：China over the years has ramped up its crackdown on all activities related to cryptocurrencies, citing financial stability risks.</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一种时态，结构是：have/has + been + 现在分词。其中have/has要根据主语的人称和数进行变化，been是be的过去分词，现在分词是动词的-ing形式。这种时态表示动作或状态从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在，强调动作或状态的持续性和未完成性。在这个例句中，它表示中国多年来一直加大力度打击所有与加密货币相关的活动，直到现在仍在进行。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>The explainer became widely circulated on Sunday after some local crypto enthusiasts suggested that it acknowledged cryptocurrencies’ legitimacy</li>

The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show.

That’s really the only place where we will not allow participation.”</p><p>Still, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show’s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.</p><p>“We like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don’t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,” said Kelley. “Instead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.”</p> ]]></description>

That counters speculation that Huawei’s mainland Chinese chipmaking partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), may have achieved a major leap in fabrication technique.</p><p>Huawei caused a stir in the US and China last August when it released a smartphone with a 7-nm processor made by Shanghai-based SMIC. A teardown by the Canada-based research outfit for Bloomberg News showed the Mate 60 Pro’s chip was only a few years behind the cutting edge, a feat that US trade curbs were meant to prevent. That revelation spurred celebration across the Chinese tech scene, and a debate in the US about the effectiveness of sanctions.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3246566/huawei-sees-9-cent-sales-growth-2023-it-bounces-back-us-sanctions-cautions-serious-challenges-ahead" title="">Huawei sees 9 per cent sales growth in 2023, boosted by Mate 60 Pro 5G comeback</a></h3><p>In the latest teardown, TechInsights discovered a Kirin 9006C processor fabricated via TSMC’s 5-nm method, which was assembled and packaged around the third quarter of 2020. Industry experts had previously speculated that SMIC achieved that milestone by developing workarounds to US sanctions, which would have marked a second technological triumph for the Chinese national champion in the span of months.</p><p>Representatives for Huawei and TSMC did not provide comment when reached by Bloomberg News.</p><p>The advances encapsulated in the Mate 60 smartphone in 2023 cemented Huawei’s role as the standard-bearer for Chinese efforts to wean itself off Western technologies and create domestic alternatives. Chinese consumers snapped up the smartphone in the final quarter, helping the company regain the symbolically important US$100 billion revenue threshold – eroding Apple’s iPhone dominance along the way.</p><p>A foray into 5-nm territory would have represented a big leap for the Shenzhen conglomerate, bringing it closer to the most-advanced processes currently in use, mostly centred around 3-nm nodes. Before TSMC cut off ties with Huawei, it was supplying chips as advanced as 5-nm to the Chinese firm.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3246414/huawei-and-xiaomi-launch-new-ev-models-china-reigniting-worries-about-price-wars-worlds-largest-ev" title="">New EVs from Huawei, Xiaomi could renew price wars in China’s car market</a></h3><p>It is unclear how Huawei managed to procure a three-year-old processor, though the Chinese company has been stockpiling vital semiconductors since the US began cutting off its access to components and gear globally. While Huawei has been on Washington’s Entity List since 2019, it was only in 2020 that TSMC stopped taking orders from Huawei to comply with elevated US trade restrictions.</p><p>Huawei has since sunk billions into chip research and stockpiling in past years, while also building a domestic network of suppliers and manufacturing partners, in some cases with government backing.</p><p>The L540 is the latest in a line of laptops that Huawei began selling around 2016, when the then-networking leader developed ambitions to get into mobile and computing devices and round out its offerings.</p><p>Its emergence coincides with a growing call from Beijing to replace foreign technology in sensitive environments, from mandates to stop using iPhones in the workplace to replacing Dell and HP computers.</p><p>Some online retailers touted that the new laptop was designed specifically to comply with recent, stringent requirements in China on data security across sensitive government organs. Huawei’s official site highlights the device’s security features, but did not go into that detail.</p> ]]></description>
