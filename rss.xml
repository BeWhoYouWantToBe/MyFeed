<link>https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3248937/private-equity-investors-return-china-search-ma-deals-2024-bain-co-says</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>English Summary：</h2>  Beijing plans to announce its annual gross domestic product, consumer inflation, and fiscal deficit targets for 2024 in March. Moreover, China's private equity investment is poised for a rebound following three consecutive years of decline. Zhou Hao, head of Bain & Co's Greater China private equity and merger and acquisition practice, predicted that deal-making negotiations might take longer, but more transactions are expected to be completed.    <ul>    <li>Main Points: Beijing to release 2024 growth targets; Private equity investors returning to China's M&A market; Longer negotiations but increased transactions; International investors seeking stable returns; Buyout funds benefiting from higher valuations; Revenue growth and Middle Eastern interest in new energy and EVs.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>中文总结：</h2>  北京已计划在三月宣布 2024 年的年度国内生产总值、消费通货膨胀率和财政赤字目标。经过连续三年的下滑后，中国的私募股权投资正准备反弹。贝恩公司大中华区私募股权和并购业务主管周浩预测，达成交易谈判可能需要更长时间，但预计将完成更多交易。  <ul>    <li>要点：北京发布 2024 年增长目标；私募股权投资者回归中国并购市场；谈判时间更长但交易量增加；国际投资者寻求稳定回报；收购基金受益于较高估值；收入增长以及中东对新能源和电动汽车的兴趣。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>pandemic (n.) - /ˌpænˈdɛmɪk/ 流行病，大流行病。    <p>原文例句：The pandemic has upended supply chains around the world and caused widespread economic disruption.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词起源于希腊语，由pan（所有），demos（人民）组成，意为“流行于所有人群的疾病”。在这个例句中，它指的是当前全球正在经历的新冠肺炎大流行病，该疾病对世界各地的供应链和经济造成了广泛破坏。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>disruption (n.) - /dɪˈsrʌpʃən/ 中断，破坏。    <p>原文例句：The pandemic has upended supply chains around the world and caused widespread economic disruption.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于拉丁语，由dis（分开），rumpere（打破）组成，意为“打破，中断”。在这个例句中，它指的是新冠肺炎大流行病对世界各地供应链和经济造成的广泛破坏和中断。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>take effect - 生效。    <p>原文例句：Some incentives Beijing rolled out last year – such as the plan to issue 1 trillion yuan (US$139 billion) worth of special treasury bonds – will take effect in 2024. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组是由take（拿，取）和effect（效果）组成的动词词组，意为“发生作用，生效”。在这个例句中，它指北京去年出台的一些激励措施，例如发行价值1万亿元人民币（1390亿美元）特别国债的计划，将于2024年生效。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>shift from - 从……转移。    <p>原文例句：Middle Eastern countries that are eager to shift from fossil fuel-based economies are pursuing opportunities for China inbound M&A deals. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组是由shift（转移）和from（从……）组成的动词词组，意为“从……转移到……”。在这个例句中，它指中东国家急于从以化石燃料为基础的经济转向，正在寻求中国国内并购交易的机会。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>Beijing will unveil its annual growth targets for gross domestic product, consumer inflation and fiscal deficit for 2024 in March, when the annual session of the National People’s Congress is held. - 北京将在三月举行的全国人民代表大会年度会议上公布国内生产总值、消费者通货膨胀和2024年财政赤字的年度增长目标。    <p>句子分析：这是一个较为复杂的句子，包含一个主句和两个从句。主句是Beijing will unveil its annual growth targets for gross domestic product, consumer inflation and fiscal deficit for 2024。其中，Beijing是主语，unveil是谓语，annual growth targets是宾语，gross domestic product、consumer inflation和fiscal deficit是并列宾语，for 2024是时间状语。第一个从句是when the annual session of the National People’s Congress is held，其中when是时间状语从句的标志，annual session of the National People’s Congress是主语，is held是谓语。第二个从句是for 2024，其中for 2024是时间状语从句，修饰主句中的unveil。这个句子的意思是，北京将在三月举行的全国人民代表大会年度会议上公布国内生产总值、消费者通货膨胀和2024年财政赤字的年度增长目标。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>被动语态 - 表示句子中的动作或状态是由句子中的宾语承受的。    <p>原文例句：The pandemic has upended supply chains around the world and caused widespread economic disruption.</p>    <p>语法讲解：在这个例句中，upended和caused都是过去分词，分别作动词has和caused的宾语补足语，表示供应链被大流行病打乱，经济受到广泛破坏。被动语态的结构是：be + 过去分词。be的时态和语态要根据句子的主语和语境来决定。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>现在完成时 - 表示从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：Private-equity funds have at least half their capital invested in China raised US$1.4 billion in the first half of last year. </p>    <p>语法讲解：在这个例句中，have raised是现在完成时的形式，表示私募股权基金从去年上半年开始一直持续到现在已经募集了14亿美元。现在完成时的结构是：have/has + 过去分词。have/has的时态和语态要根据句子的主语和语境来决定。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>It may take longer to conclude deals, ‘but it is certain that more transactions will be conducted’ in 2024, Bain executive says</li>

The different research and development funding schemes overseen by the Innovation and Technology Commission had provided total funding of some HK$400 million to about 130 green tech R&amp;D projects as of last June, according to the Environment and Ecology Bureau.</p><p>The bureau also administers a HK$400 million Green Tech Fund that supports R&amp;D projects in net-zero electricity generation, energy savings, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. Some 30 projects have received HK$132.5 million since the fund was set up in 2020.</p><p>The government’s Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and Cyberport have also set up separate funds to co-invest with angel investors and venture capital funds in start-ups at their respective industry parks.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3244092/hong-kong-regains-appeal-among-global-financial-talent-opportunities-open-fintech-esg-and-markets" title="">Hong Kong regains appeal among global talent amid demand in fintech, ESG</a></h3><p>“There is a gap between the intention and the actual projects that get financed,” said Sethi. “A lot of these are new technology projects where it is hard to prove the business case and profitability. This is where public-private collaborative funding can help.”</p><p>Other difficulties facing the government and industries include growing the talent pool, Sethi said.</p><p>Some 80 per cent of senior finance executives in the city, surveyed late last year by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said recruiting green and sustainable finance professionals was more difficult compared with other job functions. Talent retention and acquisition was the second most pressing issue after disclosure regulations.</p><p>Fostering a risk-taking mindset is another challenge, according to Sethi.</p><p>“In a lot of Asian countries, the education systems are focused on preparing students to get stable jobs, but in tech we need entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks,” he said. “It takes years and perhaps generations to change the mindset.”</p> ]]></description>

</ul><figure><img src="https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/18/0daed4bb-8aac-444e-9863-2f6975c1c780_21ab5745.jpg" /><figcaption>The Apple Vision Pro headset seen at an unveiling event in Cupertino, California last June.

The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web.</p><p>It is a sizeable omission for the US$3,499 headset, which debuts on February 2. Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology, and Netflix is a must-have streaming service for many consumers.</p><p>Netflix also offers apps for Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone and iPad, though it does not participate in the company’s TV app.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Netflix office building in Hollywood, California.

Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform, aiming to quickly amass a wide range of Vision Pro software.</p><p>The fact that Netflix is not even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it is taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It is also a bit of a reversal for the company, which said in July that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix did not plan to release software specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS.</p><p>“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. Apple declined to comment.</p><p>In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3236053/meta-launches-quest-3-vr-and-ar-headset-just-ahead-apples-vision-pro" target="_self" title="">Meta Platforms’ Quest headsets</a>, though it has not been updated in years.</p><p>The approach means it will be harder for users to access Netflix on the Vision Pro. And they will not be able to download Netflix content to watch offline, potentially making it more of a pain to use on an aeroplane.</p><p>The lack of an app also means Netflix watchers will not have access to custom environments for streaming. That means Netflix cannot create specialised immersive backdrops for its users to watch videos in.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="An Apple promotional image demonstrating how the Vision Pro can be used.

But it has been gathering award wins in the space, and the two companies compete over talent and production deals. It is plausible Netflix does not want to help boost a rival by giving it a key app for its upcoming launch.</p><p>Apple has been marketing the Vision Pro as an entertainment device in the run-up to pre-orders beginning on Friday.</p><p>The Cupertino, California-based company said earlier this week that the headset would have many entertainment options beyond its own TV+ service. That includes programming from Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video, among others.</p> ]]></description>

Samsung is paying special attention to its top-end model, the S24 Ultra. That product, which starts at US$1,299, will have a new titanium frame, matching the iPhone 15 Pro models released in September.</p><p>The borders around the displays are 42 per cent thinner, and the screen is 40 per cent brighter than the phone’s predecessor. It also sports flatter edges and a front-facing camera cut-out that is 11 per cent smaller.</p><p>The US$799 S24 and US$999 S24+ come in aluminium and get slightly larger screens than their predecessors, moving from 6.1-inch and 6.6-inch panels to 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The S24 Ultra, like the S23 Ultra, has a 6.8-inch screen.</p><p>Qualcomm is providing the main chip of the new Samsung phones in at least some regions. The S24 line-up will be based on its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 applications processor, the company said in a separate statement. That component offers the latest Wi-fi capabilities and will handle AI-assisted features such as live translation and transcription, Qualcomm said.</p><p>The new models come at a crucial time for Samsung, which is contending with market share losses and a broader smartphone slump. Last year, it lost its crown as the No 1 smartphone supplier to Apple, marking the first time Samsung has not led the market since 2010.</p><p>Samsung’s phone shipments declined nearly 14 per cent to 226.6 million units in 2023, according to research firm IDC. Apple, on the other hand, saw unit shipments increase 3.7 per cent to 234.6 million.</p><p>Samsung looks to reverse its fortunes by getting a several-month head start on AI. Apple is not expected to showcase its latest plans for artificial intelligence until June, ahead of new iPhones arriving around September. The new Galaxy phones come out on January 31, with pre-orders starting Wednesday.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Interpreter application on a Samsung S24 Ultra smartphone.

As part of a multi-year agreement, Google will be the sole provider of generative AI for Samsung’s phones and applications, including features for taking notes and recording audio, according to Kurian.</p><p>“This is a validation of the quality of our models,” Kurian said. “They were free to choose whoever they wanted.”</p><p>Users will be able to switch between two options: one called Gemini Nano that runs on the phone itself and a higher-powered Pro version that uses cloud computing. That flexibility helped Google’s offerings stand out from the competition, Kurian said.</p><p>In conjunction with Samsung’s announcements, Google also introduced a feature called “Circle to Search,” which lets people search anything on their phone screens without switching apps.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="A Samsung store in Seoul, South Korea.

The feature is launching globally on the new Galaxy S24, as well as on Google’s own Pixel 8 smartphones on January 31.</p><p>AI features on the Samsung devices will also let users change the language of a message depending on the context, such as whether it is a work memo or social media post. And new capabilities for Android Auto – Google’s in-car interface – will summarise incoming text messages and other alerts.</p><p>The companies are also applying AI to the phones’ camera systems, which are getting upgraded with new sensors, with tools to make photos sharper. The S24 Ultra replaces one of its 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with a 50-megapixel version. The S24 and S24+, meanwhile, include the same camera specifications as their predecessors.</p><p>The S24 Ultra comes with as much as 1 terabyte of storage, while the S24+ tops out at 512 gigabytes. The S24 has as much as 256GB of space. The S24+ and S24 Ultra include 12GB of memory, which is used for shorter-term storage of data, while the regular S24 has 8GB.</p> ]]></description>

The space industry is “ripe right now” for M&amp;A, he said.</p><p>The fund, known as PIF, has emerged as one of the key parts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to shake up the Saudi economy and wean it off a reliance on oil sales. It has rapidly built up assets of around US$700 billion after a spending spree on everything from electric carmakers to backing upstart golf tournaments, and plans to control US$1 trillion by 2025.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3226303/saudi-arabia-deepen-ties-hong-kong-using-city-bridge-mainland-chinas-world-class-digital-prowess" title="">Saudi Arabia to use Hong Kong as bridge to China’s tech prowess</a></h3><p>One of its key initiatives has been to develop an auto manufacturing hub on the west coast of the kingdom. US EV maker Lucid Group is already assembling cars from the site, and is set to be joined by Hyundai Motor and Ceer, a brand created by the PIF. The plan involves developing downstream industries that is expected to also include making semiconductors and batteries.</p><p>The kingdom launched its space programme in 2018 and sent astronauts into space last year, as part of a wider plan to invest in the industry.</p><div class="scmp-code-block methode-html-wrapper">

Photo: TNS</figcaption></figure><p>Generative artificial intelligence, especially OpenAI’s implementation of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3243449/chatgpt-one-year-how-openais-chatbot-brought-generative-artificial-intelligence-public-consciousness" target="_self" title="">ChatGPT,</a> has opened up new possibilities for the creation of intelligent content. In fact, AI-generated content is so good that it reads almost as if it was written by a human being.</p><p>For example, a study by researchers from US universities published in May found that when answering random patient questions from a social media platform, ChatGPT outperformed physicians in terms of both quality of information and empathy. And OpenAI has a said GPT4, the state-of-the-art model underlying ChatGPT Plus, could score in the top 10 per cent in the SAT reading exam for college admissions, the GRE verbal test for graduate school admissions and the uniform bar exam for lawyers.</p><p>This tool is expected to be deployed in companies and other organisations to enhance worker productivity. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3227884/chatgpt-helps-hong-kong-students-critical-thinking-teachers-stay-ahead-human-touch" target="_self" title="">Schools and teachers</a> are also keen to embrace it. Many universities now <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3233269/hong-kong-universities-relent-rise-chatgpt-ai-tools-teaching-and-assignments-keep-eye-out-plagiarism" target="_self" title="">allow students</a> to use generative AI in course work and assignments. Some local institutions offer free access to ChatGPT, encouraging students to use it in school.</p><p>However, generative AI has its limitations. Because the content it produces is generated from a complex large-language model instead of logically developed and based on facts, AI sometimes “hallucinates”, that is, produces incorrect or misleading results, due to insufficient training data, bias and incorrect assumptions. In June, two lawyers in the US <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3223490/us-lawyer-sorry-after-chatgpt-creates-fake-cases" target="_self" title="">were sanctioned</a> for using ChatGPT to produce a legal brief with fictitious case citations. They claimed they weren’t aware ChatGPT could make up cases.</p><p>This case raises an important question: how does generative AI affect human capability when people no longer need to develop logical arguments and verify facts when creating content?</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>Using generative AI to produce work is akin to outsourcing it to other people. Thus, we can infer its impact on human capability by referencing outsourcing.</p><p>We conducted research on how contributions to the well-known programming language, Python, changed after the introduction of a crowdsourcing program called Internet Bug Bounty (IBB), which rewards people for finding security vulnerabilities in open source software – but excludes the official system maintainers, who have been reporting and fixing bugs, and making enhancements, from the reward.</p><p>The IBB program should have made the Python maintainers’ job easier, giving them more time to perform other tasks and hence increasing their productivity in those tasks.</p><p>Interestingly, we found the opposite. The official Python maintainers not only discovered fewer bugs after the IBB program, they also made fewer enhancements to Python. This means their overall productivity fell after bug reporting was outsourced.</p><p>We looked at many reasons for the drop in productivity, including a loss of motivation due to not being rewarded in the IBB program. We concluded that it was mainly due to a lack of inter-task learning. There was a bigger drop in productivity among Python maintainers who reported more bugs before the IBB program than those who reported fewer. The drop was also bigger when the bug reporting and enhancement tasks were more closely related.</p><p>We surveyed a number of Python maintainers, most of whom said that finding vulnerabilities helped them learn and gain ideas for how to enhance the program. This implies that when performing a task, we not only contribute to the outcome, we learn at the same time.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Internet Bug Bounty program, which rewards people for identifying security vulnerabilities in open source software, should have helped increase the productivity of those whose job it is to find and fix bugs, but that has not necessarily happened.

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div><p>This inter-task learning side-effect is illuminating. It suggests that learning and other capabilities may be sacrificed when we enjoy the power and convenience of generative AI. The short-term gain in productivity could be offset by the long-term loss in capability. Worse, this capability may be key to our contribution to future tasks, including, possibly, intelligent knowledge work.</p><p>So how should generative AI use be managed in an organisation? First, distinguish between objectives – are we seeking work output or learning and training? In most places, work output may be the priority, so it would be reasonable to actively deploy generative AI tools. Even so, we must be aware this may slow employees’ learning of how to perform tasks.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3247902/how-ai-development-fostered-digital-sweatshop-and-why-it-matters-technologys-future" title="">How AI development has fostered a digital ‘sweatshop’ in poor countries</a></h3><p>Second, start classifying tasks by nature, in terms of whether they are interrelated. Generative AI tools may be better deployed for tasks that have little relation to other tasks, for example, pure automation jobs. We might wish to discourage AI’s use for deeply intertwined tasks.</p><p>Third, more training should be provided once generative AI is deployed. People are intrinsically lazy. If we let them use generative AI without supplementing it with learning opportunities, their ability may deteriorate over time.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>At school, the priority should be learning rather than work output. We must seek to prevent the unrestrained use of generative AI in homework or assignments. If students don’t do homework themselves but outsource it entirely to AI, they may soon lose the ability to reason, innovate and produce more advanced knowledge.</p><p>We must revisit the common question, “Why waste time doing mundane work when AI can do it for us?” This is a dangerous sentiment because we do work not only to produce an outcome, but to learn as well. Such learning builds the foundation for future knowledge production.</p><p>We should not get carried away by generative AI, thinking that only work outcomes matter. The learning itself is equally important, if not more so.</p><p><strong>Kai-Lung Hui is Elman Family Professor of Business and senior associate dean at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School</strong></p><p><strong>Jiali Zhou is an assistant professor at the American University in Washington DC</strong></p><p><strong>The views expressed here are the authors’ own</strong></p> ]]></description>
