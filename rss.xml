<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  Hong Kong has fallen behind the United States in authorising spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), despite the city's regulators expressing readiness to do so in December. Industry experts believe that Hong Kong should follow the US lead to strengthen its position as Asia's virtual-asset hub.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Hong Kong urged to authorise spot cryptocurrency ETFs to boost competitiveness.</li>    <li>Theme: Hong Kong's efforts to become a major virtual-asset hub are hindered by the delay in approving spot crypto ETFs.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: Urging Hong Kong regulators to expedite the approval process for spot crypto ETFs, bringing the city in line with global trends.</li>    <li>Main information: Comparison of Hong Kong's situation with the US's successful launch of spot bitcoin ETFs; potential impact on industries and market regulations; opinions from industry insiders.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  香港在授权现货加密货币交易所交易基金（ETF）方面落后于美国，尽管该市的监管机构在12月份表示准备这样做。业内专家认为，香港应该效仿美国，以加强其作为亚洲虚拟资产中心的地位。  <ul>    <li>摘要：香港须授权现货加密货币ETF以提高竞争力。</li>    <li>主题：香港努力成为一个主要虚拟资产中心的努力受到批准现货加密货币ETF的延误阻碍。</li>    <li>观点：敦促香港监管机构加快现货加密货币ETF的审批程序，使该市与全球趋势保持一致。</li>    <li>主要信息：将香港的情况与美国成功推出现货比特币ETF进行比较；对行业和市场法规的潜在影响；业内人士的意见。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>legitimacy (n.) - /lɪˈdʒɪtɪməsi/ 合法性，正当性。    <p>原文例句：Spot cryptocurrency ETFs “give the crypto industry more legitimacy and also opens up more collaboration opportunities with mainstream finance”, said RJ Ke, a researcher with ethereum scaling start-up Taiko. </p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，由legis（法律）和-timus（合法的）组成，表示“合法性，正当性”。在这个例句中，它表示现货加密货币ETF“赋予加密货币行业更多的合法性，也为与主流金融的更多合作机会敞开了大门”。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>authorise (v.) - /ˈɔːθəraɪz/ 授权，批准。    <p>原文例句：While the city’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in December said it was prepared to authorise retail access to spot virtual asset ETFs, the actual launch of such products has already fallen behind the US, according to Wang Yi, the head of quantitative investment at CSOP Asset Management, which currently runs two cryptocurrency futures ETFs.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，由auctor（作者）和-izare（使成为…）组成，表示“授权，批准”。在这个例句中，它表示虽然该市的证券及期货事务监察委员会（SFC）在12月表示准备授权散户进入现货虚拟资产ETF，但此类产品的实际推出已经落后于美国。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>in principle - 原则上，理论上。    <P>原文例句：Day pointed out that the SFC’s statement in December about being prepared to authorise such funds has “in principle opened a pathway for issuers to launch spot crypto ETFs in Hong Kong”. </P>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组表示“原则上，理论上”。在这个例句中，它表示香港证监会12月关于准备授权此类基金的声明“原则上为发行人开辟了一条在香港推出现货加密货币ETF的途径”。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>Spot cryptocurrency ETFs enable investors to gain exposure to virtual assets without directly buying any crypto tokens. - 现货加密货币ETF使投资者能够接触虚拟资产，而无需直接购买任何加密代币。<p>句子分析：这是一个复杂句，主句是Spot cryptocurrency ETFs enable investors to gain exposure to virtual assets，其中主语是Spot cryptocurrency ETFs，谓语是enable，宾语是investors to gain exposure to virtual assets。without directly buying any crypto tokens是一个介词短语作状语，表示不直接购买任何加密代币。这个句子的意思是说，现货加密货币ETF使投资者能够接触虚拟资产，而无需直接购买任何加密代币。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>虚拟语气 - 表示假设或违背事实的情况。    <p>原文例句：That was nearly three times the level that the original cryptocurrency reached in November 2022, when failed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy to send bitcoin’s price below US$17,000.</p>    <p>语法讲解：虚拟语气是英语中的一种语气，用于表示假设或违背事实的情况。在这个例句中，it was nearly three times the level that the original cryptocurrency reached in November 2022是一个虚拟语气结构，表示如果原来的加密货币在2022年11月达到这个水平，那么它将是现在的三倍。when failed crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy to send bitcoin’s price below US$17,000是一个虚拟语气结构，表示当失败的加密货币交易所FTX申请破产时，比特币的价格会低于17,000美元。</p></li>  </ul>   <ul>    <li>不定式 - 表示动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：The successful US launch of spot bitcoin ETFs is expected to help move Hong Kong regulators closer to authorising similar cryptocurrency funds to operate in the city.</p>    <p>语法讲解：不定式是由to加上动词原形的形式。它可以表示动作或状态。在这个例句中，to authorising similar cryptocurrency funds to operate in the city是一个不定式结构，表示授权类似的加密货币基金在该市运营。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Hong Kong has fallen behind the US in authorising spot cryptocurrency ETFs, even though regulators in December said the city was prepared to do so</li>

They jointly spent 303 billion yuan (US$42 billion) on games, or about US$63 per gamer last year – roughly a quarter of the amount spent by US gamers.</p>    <p>语法讲解：现在完成时是由have/has和过去分词构成的，其中have/has要根据主语的人称和数进行变化，过去分词是动词的-ed形式或不规则过去分词。这种时态表示动作或状态从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在（或结束于现在），强调动作或状态的持续性和完成性。在这个例句中，it has been ten years since he left school表示他离开学校已经十年了。这个句子的意思是说，到 2023 年底，中国有 6.68 亿游戏玩家，比 2022 年底的 6.66 亿略有增加。他们去年在游戏上总共花费了 3030 亿元（420 亿美元），或者说每位玩家花费了约 63 美元——大约是美国玩家花费的四分之一。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Industry regulator ended the year with a draft rule change designed to curb excessive consumer spending on in-game items, sparking market rout</li>
<li>China-backed games continue to make headlines around the world, and many analysts see overseas opportunities for domestic video game firms</li>

Still, Sensor Tower has observed a gradual increase in global user spending since the Christmas and 2024 New Year holiday. “Overall, the overseas market continues to offer opportunities for Chinese developers in the coming years, especially those focused on hybrid casual genres,” added Lu.</p><p>According to data from the Game Publishing Committee of the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association, the semi-official industry association, overseas revenue from China video game titles dropped 5.7 per cent in 2023 to US$16.3 billion.</p><p>Meanwhile, China’s video games industry is not an island and faces the same headwinds as the wider economy – namely weak domestic consumption amid an unsteady, post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>Matthew Chen, co-founder and chief operating officer of Chengdu-based Zencat Gaming in southwestern Sichuan province, said that players in China “are not spending that much money amid a slowing economy”.</p><p>UBS analyst Christine Peng said this week that heightened fears among consumers about salary cuts and job security have dragged down retail sales growth in the world’s second-largest economy. The Swiss bank expects China’s retail sales to climb 5.5 per cent in 2024, one percentage point lower than the estimated 6.5 per cent rise last year.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3246011/china-tighten-controls-video-gaming-industry-prompting-sell-tencent-and-neteast-shares" title="">China to curb excess spending on video games in blow for world’s biggest market</a></h3><p>Wu, the Guangzhou-based video games worker, said that the end of strict pandemic controls in late 2022 led to some good signs in the first few months, but added “demand for gaming [subsequently] gave way to the need [to spend] on necessities”.</p><p>Meanwhile, the overall tone of policy towards the industry remains uncertain. As things stand, all online video games must go through rigorous screening to obtain licences before being released to the public and monetised, and all players are required to have real-name registration.</p><p>Earlier this week, Tencent announced its winter policy for players aged under 18 – they can only play its games online for a combined 16 hours between January 22 and February 24. The rule is designed to comply with Beijing’s 2021 move to impose a play time ceiling for minors.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The biggest revenue-generating mobile game in 2023 remained Honour of Kings , released by Tencent Holdings in 2015.

NetEase, the country’s No. 2 gaming operator, fell by nearly a quarter in a single trading day, with Tencent dropping over 12 per cent.</p><p>Zeng Xiaofeng, vice-president of industry research firm Niko Partners, expects the rule change – if passed in its present form – to hit titles that rely heavily on loot boxes for monetisation or incentives for user acquisition, and those that have a large number of high spenders.</p><p>Popular games like Tencent’s <em>Honour of Kings</em> and NetEase’s <em>Eggy Party</em> are less likely to be impacted, as both have relatively low average revenue per user, according to Niko Partners.</p><p>Around 26 per cent of China’s mobile game users are payers, while high spenders – which refers to players that spend 300 yuan (US$42) monthly – only account for 2.5 per cent of mobile gamers in China, according to Niko Partners.</p><p>However, in the wake of the market rout triggered by the NPPA’s action, Beijing attempted to limit the damage by stating its desire for “healthy” development of the industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Feng Shixin, a key figure overseeing the industry, subsequently stepped down from his official role as the publication bureau chief at the Communist Party’s Central Propaganda Department, according to a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3247044/veteran-chinese-video-gaming-official-steps-down-wake-market-rout-linked-proposed-rule-changes" target="_self" title="">Post report</a> citing sources.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3245240/bytedance-throws-towel-video-games-chinese-studio-mihoyo-claims-global-wins-honkai" title="">As ByteDance retreats in video games, miHoYo claims global wins with new title</a></h3><p>And Beijing approved 105 new video game licences in December, the most in 17 months. In 2023 the regulator issued 1,075 licences for domestic and foreign games, more than double the number in 2022. 98 imported titles also received the greenlight in 2023, up from 44 in 2022, and Niko Partners expects another increase this year.</p><p>CBJ’s Zhang says that in terms of innovation, local developers are likely to “leverage augmented and virtual reality equipment and software” as well as “artificial intelligence (AI) to make the same game playable across different platforms – mobile, desktop and consoles – for a more immersive gameplay experience”.</p><p>Meanwhile, many of the industry workers the Post interviewed have used generative AI, the technology popularised by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, to produce various gaming content, including text, images and video.</p><p>Zencat Gaming’s Chen said that the use of AI tools to modify pictures, generate video and dub animated characters can cut the costs of overall video game development by roughly 20 per cent.</p><p>This can be a double-edged sword though. As Wu, the Guangzhou-based industry worker pointed out, while the new technology can be a “great assistant” it may very well kill entry-level jobs.</p> ]]></description>
