The different research and development funding schemes overseen by the Innovation and Technology Commission had provided total funding of some HK$400 million to about 130 green tech R&amp;D projects as of last June, according to the Environment and Ecology Bureau.</p><p>The bureau also administers a HK$400 million Green Tech Fund that supports R&amp;D projects in net-zero electricity generation, energy savings, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction. Some 30 projects have received HK$132.5 million since the fund was set up in 2020.</p><p>The government’s Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and Cyberport have also set up separate funds to co-invest with angel investors and venture capital funds in start-ups at their respective industry parks.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3244092/hong-kong-regains-appeal-among-global-financial-talent-opportunities-open-fintech-esg-and-markets" title="">Hong Kong regains appeal among global talent amid demand in fintech, ESG</a></h3><p>“There is a gap between the intention and the actual projects that get financed,” said Sethi. “A lot of these are new technology projects where it is hard to prove the business case and profitability. This is where public-private collaborative funding can help.”</p><p>Other difficulties facing the government and industries include growing the talent pool, Sethi said.</p><p>Some 80 per cent of senior finance executives in the city, surveyed late last year by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said recruiting green and sustainable finance professionals was more difficult compared with other job functions. Talent retention and acquisition was the second most pressing issue after disclosure regulations.</p><p>Fostering a risk-taking mindset is another challenge, according to Sethi.</p><p>“In a lot of Asian countries, the education systems are focused on preparing students to get stable jobs, but in tech we need entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks,” he said. “It takes years and perhaps generations to change the mindset.”</p> ]]></description>

<link>https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3248870/apples-vision-pro-headset-will-be-missing-netflix-app-launch-february</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  Netflix will not be developing an app for Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, despite it being a major player in the streaming industry. Instead, users will have to watch Netflix content on the Vision Pro through a web browser, without the ability to download content for offline viewing or access custom environments. This decision suggests that Netflix is taking a cautious approach to the Vision Pro, potentially due to its rivalry with Apple in the streaming market.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Netflix's decision not to develop an app for Apple's Vision Pro headset.</li>    <li>Theme: The dynamics of competition and collaboration between streaming giants Netflix and Apple.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: Netflix's cautious approach to the Vision Pro may stem from its rivalry with Apple in the streaming industry.</li>    <li>Main information: Netflix users will access content on the Vision Pro through a web browser; no offline viewing or custom environments; Netflix's decision may be influenced by competition with Apple.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  Netflix宣布不会为苹果即将推出的Vision Pro头显开发应用程序，尽管它在流媒体行业中扮演着重要角色。相反，用户将需要通过网络浏览器在Vision Pro上观看Netflix内容，而无法下载内容以供离线观看或访问自定义环境。这一决定表明，Netflix对Vision Pro采取了谨慎的态度，这可能是由于它在流媒体市场上与苹果存在竞争关系。  <ul>    <li>摘要：Netflix决定不为苹果的Vision Pro头显开发应用程序。</li>    <li>主题：流媒体巨头Netflix和Apple在竞争与合作之间的微妙关系。</li>    <li>观点：Netflix对Vision Pro的谨慎态度可能源于它在流媒体行业与苹果的竞争关系。</li>    <li>主要信息：Netflix用户将通过网络浏览器访问Vision Pro上的内容；没有离线观看或自定义环境；Netflix的决定可能受到与苹果的竞争影响。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>headset (n.) - /ˈhedˌset/ 耳机，头戴式耳机。    <p>原文例句：The Apple Vision Pro headset seen at an unveiling event in Cupertino, California last June.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词是由head（头部）和set（设置）构成的，表示“一种戴在头上的设备，通常用于听音乐或打电话”。在这个例句中，它指的是去年6月在加州库比蒂诺举行的发布会上展示的苹果Vision Pro头显。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>subscription (n.) - /səbˈskrɪpʃən/ 订阅，订购。    <p>原文例句：Netflix is the world’s biggest video subscription service.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词是由sub-（在……之下）和scribe（写）构成的，表示“一种定期支付费用以获得某项服务或产品的权利”。在这个例句中，它指的是Netflix作为世界上最大的视频订阅服务。</p></li>  </ul>    <ul>    <li>nascent (adj.) - /ˈneɪsnt/ 新生的，初生的。    <p>原文例句：Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于Latin，由nasci（出生）构成，表示“新生的，初生的”。在这个例句中，它描述了苹果公司押注于娱乐内容来帮助营销这项新兴且昂贵的技术。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>take a pass - 放弃，不参与。    <p>原文例句：Rather than designing a Vision Pro app – or even just supporting its existing iPad app on the platform – Netflix is essentially taking a pass.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由take和pass组成，表示“放弃，不参与”。在这个例句中，它描述了Netflix公司基本上放弃了为Vision Pro设计应用程序，甚至只是支持其现有的iPad应用程序。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>make it easy to - 使……变得容易。    <p>原文例句：Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由make和it easy to组成，表示“使……变得容易”。在这个例句中，它描述了苹果公司努力使开发人员能够轻松地将他们当前的iPad应用程序转移到新平台上。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>on the platform - 在平台上。    <p>原文例句：Rather than designing a Vision Pro app – or even just supporting its existing iPad app on the platform – Netflix is essentially taking a pass.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由on和platform组成，表示“在平台上”。在这个例句中，它描述了Netflix公司基本上放弃了为Vision Pro设计应用程序，甚至只是支持其现有的iPad应用程序。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for Meta Platforms’ Quest headsets, though it has not been updated in years. - 相比之下，Netflix为Meta Platforms的Quest头显开发了一款应用程序，尽管它已经好几年没有更新了。<p>句子分析：这是一个复杂句，主句是Netflix did develop an app，其中主语是Netflix，谓语是did develop，宾语是an app。In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy是一个介词短语作状语，表示与Vision Pro战略形成对比。though it has not been updated in years是一个现在完成时分词短语作状语，表示尽管它已经好几年没有更新了。这个句子的意思是说，相比之下，Netflix为Meta Platforms的Quest头显开发了一款应用程序，尽管它已经好几年没有更新了。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>过去分词作状语 - 表示动作或状态发生在主句动作或状态之前。    <p>原文例句：The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web.</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个常见的句型，表示动作或状态发生在主句动作或状态之前。结构是：过去分词+主句。其中过去分词是动词的过去分词形式。在这个例句中，过去分词是competes，表示竞争，作状语，表示这句话发生在这个动作或状态之前。这个句子的意思是说，这家与苹果在流媒体领域竞争的公司在一份声明中表示，有兴趣在设备上观看其内容的用户可以通过网络观看。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Rather than designing a Vision Pro app or supporting its existing iPad app on the platform, Netflix says users can watch its content on a web browser</li>

The company, which competes with Apple in streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching its content on the device can do so from the web.</p><p>It is a sizeable omission for the US$3,499 headset, which debuts on February 2. Apple is banking on entertainment content to help market the nascent and pricey technology, and Netflix is a must-have streaming service for many consumers.</p><p>Netflix also offers apps for Apple’s other devices, including the iPhone and iPad, though it does not participate in the company’s TV app.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Netflix office building in Hollywood, California.

Apple has sought to make it easy to transfer developers’ current iPad apps over to the new platform, aiming to quickly amass a wide range of Vision Pro software.</p><p>The fact that Netflix is not even willing to support the iPad approach suggests that it is taking a wait-and-see stance with the headset. It is also a bit of a reversal for the company, which said in July that it would support its iPad app on the Vision Pro. Even then, though, Netflix did not plan to release software specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS.</p><p>“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. Apple declined to comment.</p><p>In contrast with its Vision Pro strategy, Netflix did develop an app for <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3236053/meta-launches-quest-3-vr-and-ar-headset-just-ahead-apples-vision-pro" target="_self" title="">Meta Platforms’ Quest headsets</a>, though it has not been updated in years.</p><p>The approach means it will be harder for users to access Netflix on the Vision Pro. And they will not be able to download Netflix content to watch offline, potentially making it more of a pain to use on an aeroplane.</p><p>The lack of an app also means Netflix watchers will not have access to custom environments for streaming. That means Netflix cannot create specialised immersive backdrops for its users to watch videos in.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="An Apple promotional image demonstrating how the Vision Pro can be used.

But it has been gathering award wins in the space, and the two companies compete over talent and production deals. It is plausible Netflix does not want to help boost a rival by giving it a key app for its upcoming launch.</p><p>Apple has been marketing the Vision Pro as an entertainment device in the run-up to pre-orders beginning on Friday.</p><p>The Cupertino, California-based company said earlier this week that the headset would have many entertainment options beyond its own TV+ service. That includes programming from Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video, among others.</p> ]]></description>

Samsung is paying special attention to its top-end model, the S24 Ultra. That product, which starts at US$1,299, will have a new titanium frame, matching the iPhone 15 Pro models released in September.</p><p>The borders around the displays are 42 per cent thinner, and the screen is 40 per cent brighter than the phone’s predecessor. It also sports flatter edges and a front-facing camera cut-out that is 11 per cent smaller.</p><p>The US$799 S24 and US$999 S24+ come in aluminium and get slightly larger screens than their predecessors, moving from 6.1-inch and 6.6-inch panels to 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The S24 Ultra, like the S23 Ultra, has a 6.8-inch screen.</p><p>Qualcomm is providing the main chip of the new Samsung phones in at least some regions. The S24 line-up will be based on its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 applications processor, the company said in a separate statement. That component offers the latest Wi-fi capabilities and will handle AI-assisted features such as live translation and transcription, Qualcomm said.</p><p>The new models come at a crucial time for Samsung, which is contending with market share losses and a broader smartphone slump. Last year, it lost its crown as the No 1 smartphone supplier to Apple, marking the first time Samsung has not led the market since 2010.</p><p>Samsung’s phone shipments declined nearly 14 per cent to 226.6 million units in 2023, according to research firm IDC. Apple, on the other hand, saw unit shipments increase 3.7 per cent to 234.6 million.</p><p>Samsung looks to reverse its fortunes by getting a several-month head start on AI. Apple is not expected to showcase its latest plans for artificial intelligence until June, ahead of new iPhones arriving around September. The new Galaxy phones come out on January 31, with pre-orders starting Wednesday.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Interpreter application on a Samsung S24 Ultra smartphone.

As part of a multi-year agreement, Google will be the sole provider of generative AI for Samsung’s phones and applications, including features for taking notes and recording audio, according to Kurian.</p><p>“This is a validation of the quality of our models,” Kurian said. “They were free to choose whoever they wanted.”</p><p>Users will be able to switch between two options: one called Gemini Nano that runs on the phone itself and a higher-powered Pro version that uses cloud computing. That flexibility helped Google’s offerings stand out from the competition, Kurian said.</p><p>In conjunction with Samsung’s announcements, Google also introduced a feature called “Circle to Search,” which lets people search anything on their phone screens without switching apps.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="A Samsung store in Seoul, South Korea.

The feature is launching globally on the new Galaxy S24, as well as on Google’s own Pixel 8 smartphones on January 31.</p><p>AI features on the Samsung devices will also let users change the language of a message depending on the context, such as whether it is a work memo or social media post. And new capabilities for Android Auto – Google’s in-car interface – will summarise incoming text messages and other alerts.</p><p>The companies are also applying AI to the phones’ camera systems, which are getting upgraded with new sensors, with tools to make photos sharper. The S24 Ultra replaces one of its 10-megapixel telephoto cameras with a 50-megapixel version. The S24 and S24+, meanwhile, include the same camera specifications as their predecessors.</p><p>The S24 Ultra comes with as much as 1 terabyte of storage, while the S24+ tops out at 512 gigabytes. The S24 has as much as 256GB of space. The S24+ and S24 Ultra include 12GB of memory, which is used for shorter-term storage of data, while the regular S24 has 8GB.</p> ]]></description>

The space industry is “ripe right now” for M&amp;A, he said.</p><p>The fund, known as PIF, has emerged as one of the key parts of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to shake up the Saudi economy and wean it off a reliance on oil sales. It has rapidly built up assets of around US$700 billion after a spending spree on everything from electric carmakers to backing upstart golf tournaments, and plans to control US$1 trillion by 2025.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/3226303/saudi-arabia-deepen-ties-hong-kong-using-city-bridge-mainland-chinas-world-class-digital-prowess" title="">Saudi Arabia to use Hong Kong as bridge to China’s tech prowess</a></h3><p>One of its key initiatives has been to develop an auto manufacturing hub on the west coast of the kingdom. US EV maker Lucid Group is already assembling cars from the site, and is set to be joined by Hyundai Motor and Ceer, a brand created by the PIF. The plan involves developing downstream industries that is expected to also include making semiconductors and batteries.</p><p>The kingdom launched its space programme in 2018 and sent astronauts into space last year, as part of a wider plan to invest in the industry.</p><div class="scmp-code-block methode-html-wrapper">
</div><p>“The new space economy is definitely the next trillion-dollar opportunity,” Al-Swaha said. “The kingdom is very bullish on not only becoming a regional leader in this space but also a global leader. The ambition by 2030 is to definitely establish regional leadership and then move on by 2040 to global leadership.”</p><p>A key part of Saudi Arabia’s space investments will be in communications, Alswaha said. “2.6 billion people in 2024 are still not connected and the only way to connect the unconnected is from the skies.”</p><p>Alswaha said that Saudi Arabia expects to be able to continue to attract investment from both US and Chinese technologies companies, even as tensions between the world’s two largest economies escalate. The kingdom “has demonstrated our partnership with both east and west on protecting their intellectual property and patents and any potential technology leakage,” Alswaha said.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is “pro-investment, pro-partnership and open market,” he said. “Anybody that complies with our regulatory, security requirements, serves our national interest, we will work with.”</p> ]]></description>

<title>Should we let AI take over mundane work? Not so fast</title>
<link>https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3248614/should-we-let-ai-take-over-mundane-work-not-so-fast</link>
<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  The use of generative AI like ChatGPT may increase productivity, but it can also limit the supplementary learning that occurs when people do certain tasks. This is because generative AI generates content from a complex large-language model instead of logically developing it based on facts, leading to potential inaccuracies and misleading results. Outsourcing tasks to generative AI is similar to outsourcing them to other people, and studies have shown that this can lead to a decrease in productivity and learning, particularly for tasks that are closely related. Therefore, organizations and individuals should carefully consider the objectives of using generative AI and provide additional training to mitigate its potential negative effects on human capability and learning.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Generative AI's impact on productivity and human capability.</li>    <li>Theme: The potential negative effects of generative AI on learning and human capability, particularly in the context of outsourcing tasks.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: The importance of considering both work output and learning when deploying generative AI, and the need for careful management and training to mitigate its negative effects.</li>    <li>Main information: Studies showing the decrease in productivity and learning when outsourcing tasks to generative AI; the need to distinguish between objectives (work output vs. learning) when deploying generative AI; the importance of classifying tasks by nature and providing additional training to mitigate negative effects; the danger of unrestrained use of generative AI in education.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  使用像ChatGPT这样的生成式AI可能会提高生产力，但它也可能限制人们在执行某些任务时所获得的补充性学习。这是因为生成式人工智能从复杂的大语言模型生成内容，而不是在事实的基础上进行逻辑开发，导致潜在的不准确和误导性结果。将任务外包给生成式人工智能就如同将它们外包给其他人，研究表明，这可能导致生产力和学习的下降，特别是对于那些密切相关的任务。因此，组织和个人在使用生成式人工智能时应仔细考虑其目标，并提供额外的培训，以减轻其对人类能力和学习的潜在负面影响。  <ul>    <li>摘要：生成式人工智能对生产力和人类能力的影响。</li>    <li>主题：生成式人工智能对学习和人类能力的潜在负面影响，尤其是在外包任务的背景下。</li>    <li>观点：在部署生成式人工智能时考虑工作产出和学习的重要性，以及仔细管理和培训以减轻其负面影响的必要性。</li>    <li>主要信息：研究表明，将任务外包给生成式人工智能时生产力和学习力下降；在部署生成式人工智能时需要区分目标（工作产出与学习）；任务分类的必要性以及提供额外培训以减轻负面影响；在教育中不加节制地使用生成式人工智能的危险性。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>supplement (v.) - /ˈsʌplɪmɛnt/ 补充，使完整。    <p>原文例句：However, it might actually limit the supplementary learning that occurs when people do certain tasks, so AI must be deployed with care.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于拉丁语，由sub-（在……下面）和plere（填充）组成，意思是“使完整，弥补”。在这个例句中，它指的是生成式人工智能可能会限制人们在执行某些任务时所获得的补充性学习。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>acknowledge (v.) - /ækˈnɑːlɪdʒ/ 承认，认识到。    <p>原文例句：This case raises an important question: how does generative AI affect human capability when people no longer need to develop logical arguments and verify facts when creating content?</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来源于古法语单词“a con essayer”，意思是“同意”。在这个例句中，它指的是生成式人工智能会对人类能力产生什么影响，因为人们在创建内容时不再需要发展逻辑论证和核实事实。</p></li>  </ul>  </div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>in terms of - 就……而言，从……方面来说。    <P>原文例句：We looked at many reasons for the drop in productivity, including a loss of motivation due to not being rewarded in the IBB program.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组是由in（在……里面），terms（条件，条款）和of（属于，关于）构成的，表示“按照某种标准或角度来衡量或评价”。在这个例句中，它表示我们从很多方面研究了生产力下降的原因，包括由于没有在IBB计划中获得奖励而导致的动力丧失。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>This inter-task learning side-effect is illuminating. - 这种跨任务的学习副作用具有启发性。<p>句子分析：这是一个简单句，主语是This inter-task learning side-effect，谓语是is illuminating。This inter-task learning side-effect是一个名词短语，表示“这种跨任务的学习副作用”。is illuminating是一个系动词，表示“具有启发性”。这个句子的意思是说，这种跨任务的学习副作用具有启发性。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>被动语态 - 表示动作或状态是由主语承受的。    <p>原文例句：The official Python maintainers not only discovered fewer bugs after the IBB program, they also made fewer enhancements to Python. - 官方的Python维护者在IBB项目后不仅发现的bug更少了，而且对Python的改进也更少了。</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个被动语态的句子，主语是The official Python maintainers，谓语是被动语态动词discovered和made。discovered是由discover的过去分词加上助动词was/were构成的，made是由make的过去分词加上助动词was/were构成的。这个句子的意思是说，官方的Python维护者在IBB项目后不仅发现的bug更少了，而且对Python的改进也更少了。</p></li>  </ul>   <ul>    <li>现在完成时 - 表示从过去某个时间开始一直持续到现在的动作或状态。    <p>原文例句：We looked at many reasons for the drop in productivity, including a loss of motivation due to not being rewarded in the IBB program. - 我们研究了生产力下降的许多原因，包括由于没有在IBB计划中获得奖励而导致的动力丧失。</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个现在完成时的句子，主语是we，谓语是have looked。have looked是由have和look的过去分词looked构成的。这个句子的意思是说，我们研究了生产力下降的许多原因，包括由于没有在IBB计划中获得奖励而导致的动力丧失。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>It may seem that outsourcing tasks to generative AI like ChatGPT could increase productivity</li>

Photo: TNS</figcaption></figure><p>Generative artificial intelligence, especially OpenAI’s implementation of <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3243449/chatgpt-one-year-how-openais-chatbot-brought-generative-artificial-intelligence-public-consciousness" target="_self" title="">ChatGPT,</a> has opened up new possibilities for the creation of intelligent content. In fact, AI-generated content is so good that it reads almost as if it was written by a human being.</p><p>For example, a study by researchers from US universities published in May found that when answering random patient questions from a social media platform, ChatGPT outperformed physicians in terms of both quality of information and empathy. And OpenAI has a said GPT4, the state-of-the-art model underlying ChatGPT Plus, could score in the top 10 per cent in the SAT reading exam for college admissions, the GRE verbal test for graduate school admissions and the uniform bar exam for lawyers.</p><p>This tool is expected to be deployed in companies and other organisations to enhance worker productivity. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3227884/chatgpt-helps-hong-kong-students-critical-thinking-teachers-stay-ahead-human-touch" target="_self" title="">Schools and teachers</a> are also keen to embrace it. Many universities now <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3233269/hong-kong-universities-relent-rise-chatgpt-ai-tools-teaching-and-assignments-keep-eye-out-plagiarism" target="_self" title="">allow students</a> to use generative AI in course work and assignments. Some local institutions offer free access to ChatGPT, encouraging students to use it in school.</p><p>However, generative AI has its limitations. Because the content it produces is generated from a complex large-language model instead of logically developed and based on facts, AI sometimes “hallucinates”, that is, produces incorrect or misleading results, due to insufficient training data, bias and incorrect assumptions. In June, two lawyers in the US <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3223490/us-lawyer-sorry-after-chatgpt-creates-fake-cases" target="_self" title="">were sanctioned</a> for using ChatGPT to produce a legal brief with fictitious case citations. They claimed they weren’t aware ChatGPT could make up cases.</p><p>This case raises an important question: how does generative AI affect human capability when people no longer need to develop logical arguments and verify facts when creating content?</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>Using generative AI to produce work is akin to outsourcing it to other people. Thus, we can infer its impact on human capability by referencing outsourcing.</p><p>We conducted research on how contributions to the well-known programming language, Python, changed after the introduction of a crowdsourcing program called Internet Bug Bounty (IBB), which rewards people for finding security vulnerabilities in open source software – but excludes the official system maintainers, who have been reporting and fixing bugs, and making enhancements, from the reward.</p><p>The IBB program should have made the Python maintainers’ job easier, giving them more time to perform other tasks and hence increasing their productivity in those tasks.</p><p>Interestingly, we found the opposite. The official Python maintainers not only discovered fewer bugs after the IBB program, they also made fewer enhancements to Python. This means their overall productivity fell after bug reporting was outsourced.</p><p>We looked at many reasons for the drop in productivity, including a loss of motivation due to not being rewarded in the IBB program. We concluded that it was mainly due to a lack of inter-task learning. There was a bigger drop in productivity among Python maintainers who reported more bugs before the IBB program than those who reported fewer. The drop was also bigger when the bug reporting and enhancement tasks were more closely related.</p><p>We surveyed a number of Python maintainers, most of whom said that finding vulnerabilities helped them learn and gain ideas for how to enhance the program. This implies that when performing a task, we not only contribute to the outcome, we learn at the same time.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="The Internet Bug Bounty program, which rewards people for identifying security vulnerabilities in open source software, should have helped increase the productivity of those whose job it is to find and fix bugs, but that has not necessarily happened.

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div><p>This inter-task learning side-effect is illuminating. It suggests that learning and other capabilities may be sacrificed when we enjoy the power and convenience of generative AI. The short-term gain in productivity could be offset by the long-term loss in capability. Worse, this capability may be key to our contribution to future tasks, including, possibly, intelligent knowledge work.</p><p>So how should generative AI use be managed in an organisation? First, distinguish between objectives – are we seeking work output or learning and training? In most places, work output may be the priority, so it would be reasonable to actively deploy generative AI tools. Even so, we must be aware this may slow employees’ learning of how to perform tasks.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3247902/how-ai-development-fostered-digital-sweatshop-and-why-it-matters-technologys-future" title="">How AI development has fostered a digital ‘sweatshop’ in poor countries</a></h3><p>Second, start classifying tasks by nature, in terms of whether they are interrelated. Generative AI tools may be better deployed for tasks that have little relation to other tasks, for example, pure automation jobs. We might wish to discourage AI’s use for deeply intertwined tasks.</p><p>Third, more training should be provided once generative AI is deployed. People are intrinsically lazy. If we let them use generative AI without supplementing it with learning opportunities, their ability may deteriorate over time.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>At school, the priority should be learning rather than work output. We must seek to prevent the unrestrained use of generative AI in homework or assignments. If students don’t do homework themselves but outsource it entirely to AI, they may soon lose the ability to reason, innovate and produce more advanced knowledge.</p><p>We must revisit the common question, “Why waste time doing mundane work when AI can do it for us?” This is a dangerous sentiment because we do work not only to produce an outcome, but to learn as well. Such learning builds the foundation for future knowledge production.</p><p>We should not get carried away by generative AI, thinking that only work outcomes matter. The learning itself is equally important, if not more so.</p><p><strong>Kai-Lung Hui is Elman Family Professor of Business and senior associate dean at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Business School</strong></p><p><strong>Jiali Zhou is an assistant professor at the American University in Washington DC</strong></p><p><strong>The views expressed here are the authors’ own</strong></p> ]]></description>

<title>Davos 2024: Microsoft CEO ‘comfortable’ with OpenAI non-profit board structure despite Altman ousting</title>

<description><![CDATA[ <div>  <h2>Summary：</h2>  At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella expressed his support for OpenAI's governance structure and its non-profit mission to develop beneficial artificial intelligence (AI). He highlighted the importance of partnerships and competition in driving innovation. Nadella believes that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, including computing power and resources, was a risky move that defied conventional wisdom.  <ul>    <li>Abstract: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella endorses OpenAI's governance and emphasizes the role of partnerships in fostering competition.</li>    <li>Theme: Microsoft's support for OpenAI's non-profit mission and its emphasis on collaboration and competition in the AI landscape.</li>    <li>Viewpoint: Nadella's perspective on the benefits of partnerships and his confidence in OpenAI's governance structure.</li>    <li>Main information: Nadella's comments at the WEF; OpenAI's mission and its temporary CEO dismissal; Microsoft's observer position on OpenAI's board; scrutiny of the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship by competition authorities.</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>总结：</h2>  微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉在达沃斯世界经济论坛的间隙接受采访时表示，他对OpenAI的治理结构“没有任何意见”。纳德拉认为，微软没有完全拥有OpenAI，使他们的交易以一种有利于竞争的方式区别开来。微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉周二表示，他对合作伙伴OpenAI的治理结构没有任何意见，就在这家初创公司的非营利董事会临时罢免其首席执行官两个月后，而没有考虑投资者的利益。OpenAI首席执行官萨姆·奥特曼因涉嫌沟通失误而突然被解雇，引发了这家ChatGPT背后的初创公司的危机，该公司员工威胁要集体辞职并为微软工作，而微软正以数十亿美元支持OpenAI。纳德拉在彭博新闻社在达沃斯世界经济论坛年会间隙举行的一次活动中表示：“我很舒服。我对任何结构都没有意见。” OpenAI董事会负责保护这家初创非营利组织的使命，即开发对人类有益的强大的人工智能，最终在几天后恢复了奥特曼的职务，现在正在填补其成员。OpenAI首席执行官奥特曼周二在达沃斯举行的的彭博晚些时候活动中表示：“我预计我们将在未来几个月取得很大进展。” “在那之后，新董事会将审查治理结构。”他说：“我们将从各个角度研究它。”微软现在已在OpenAI董事会获得一个没有投票权的观察员席位。据报道，欧洲、英国和美国的竞争当局已经开始密切关注微软与OpenAI的关系。一位了解条款的人士表示，他们的协议保证了Windows制造商在满足某些条件的情况下获得大量初创公司的利润。根据纳德拉的说法，微软没有完全拥有OpenAI这一事实以一种有利于竞争的方式区别了他们的交易。他表示：“事实上，合作是实现竞争的一种途径。”纳德拉表示，微软对计算能力的投资以及在OpenAI的ChatGPT成名之前多年的押注是一次“高风险的押注”，而且“并非所有传统智慧都是如此”。  <ul>    <li>摘要：微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉支持OpenAI的治理，并强调合作在促进竞争中的作用。</li>    <li>主题：微软支持OpenAI的非盈利使命，并强调在人工智能领域合作与竞争的重要性。</li>    <li>观点：纳德拉对合作收益的看法以及他对OpenAI治理结构的信心。</li>    <li>主要信息：纳德拉在世界经济论坛上的评论；OpenAI的使命及其临时首席执行官被解雇；微软在OpenAI董事会中的观察员职位；竞争当局对微软与OpenAI关系的审查。</li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>单词：</h2>  <ul>    <li>distinguish (v.) - /dɪˈstɪŋɡwɪʃ/ 区分，识别。    <p>原文例句：The fact that Microsoft does not fully own OpenAI distinguished their deal in a pro-competitive way, according to Nadella</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来自于Latin，由dis-（分开）和stinguere（熄灭）组成，意思为“分开，区别，识别，区分开来”。在这个例句中，它指的是微软没有完全拥有OpenAI这个事实使他们的交易以一种有利于竞争的方式区分开来。</p></li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>governance (n.) - /ˈɡʌvərˌnəns/ 治理，管理。    <p>原文例句：OpenAI’s board, charged with protecting the start-up non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity, ultimately restored Altman days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership.</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个单词来自于French，由govern（统治，治理）和-ance（状态，行为）组成，意思为“治理，管理”。在这个例句中，它指的是OpenAI的董事会负责保护这家初创非营利组织的使命，即开发对人类有益的强大的人工智能。</p></li>  </ul>  </div><div>  <h2>词组：</h2>  <ul>    <li>in a pro-competitive way - 以一种有利于竞争的方式。    <P>原文例句：The fact that Microsoft does not fully own OpenAI distinguished their deal in a pro-competitive way, according to Nadella</p>    <p>例句讲解：这个词组由in（在……里面），a（一个），pro-competitive（有利于竞争的），way（方式）组成，表示“以一种有利于竞争的方式”。在这个例句中，它表示微软没有完全拥有OpenAI这个事实使他们的交易以一种有利于竞争的方式区分开来。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>句子：</h2>  <ul>    <li>OpenAI’s board, charged with protecting the start-up non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity, ultimately restored Altman days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership. - OpenAI的董事会负责保护这家初创非营利组织的使命，即开发对人类有益的强大的人工智能，最终在几天后恢复了奥特曼的职务，现在正在填补其成员。<p>句子分析：这是一个复杂句，主句是OpenAI’s board restored Altman，其中主语是OpenAI’s board，谓语是restored，宾语是Altman。charged with protecting the start-up non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity是一个现在分词短语作定语，修饰OpenAI’s board，表示OpenAI的董事会负责保护这家初创非营利组织的使命，即开发对人类有益的强大的人工智能。days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership是一个现在分词短语作状语，修饰restored，表示最终在几天后恢复了奥特曼的职务，现在正在填补其成员。这个句子的意思是说，OpenAI的董事会负责保护这家初创非营利组织的使命，即开发对人类有益的强大的人工智能，最终在几天后恢复了奥特曼的职务，现在正在填补其成员。</p></li>  </ul></div><div>  <h2>语法：</h2>  <ul>    <li>现在分词短语作定语 - 用于修饰名词或代词，使其更具体更详细。    <p>原文例句：OpenAI’s board, charged with protecting the start-up non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity, ultimately restored Altman days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership. </p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个现在分词短语作定语，由charged with protecting the start-up non-profit’s mission to develop powerful artificial intelligence that benefits humanity构成，修饰名词或代词OpenAI’s board，使其更具体更详细。</p></li>  </ul>   <ul>    <li>现在分词短语作状语 - 用于修饰动词或形容词，使其更具体更详细。    <p>原文例句：days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership</p>    <p>语法讲解：这是一个现在分词短语作状语，由days later and now is in the process of filling out its membership构成，修饰动词restored，使其更具体更详细。</p></li>  </ul></div>  <ul><li>Satya Nadella, speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s meeting in Davos, says he has ‘no issues with any structure’ at OpenAI</li>
