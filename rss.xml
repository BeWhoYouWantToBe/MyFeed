But at the end of the day, when we achieve 100 per cent electric cars, there will be very tiny amounts of new critical materials to be mined.”</p><p>China leads the world in battery recycling technologies, an important solution for addressing battery material shortages.</p><p>For instance, Zeng told the forum that CATL currently has the capacity to recycle as much as 99.6 per cent of precious metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese, and up to 91 per cent of lithium, higher than Europe’s capacity of 70 per cent to 80 per cent. Last year, CATL recycled 100,000 tonnes of waste batteries through its subsidiary Brump to create 13,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate, he said.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3244015/chinese-ev-battery-giant-catl-will-set-research-and-development-centre-hong-kong-win-government" title="">EV battery giant CATL to open research and development centre in Hong Kong</a></h3><p>But CATL’s business has been affected by the fraught relations between Beijing and the West. In December, for instance, CATL was accused of posing a national security threat in the US and was banned from a US military base. The allegation was based on a letter from US lawmakers led by Republican senator Marco Rubio that said CATL enjoyed a close relationship with the Chinese leadership in Beijing.</p><p>“We are fighting climate change … so whatever the geopolitical issues are, we have to find a way,” Zeng said during the panel.</p><p>As sales of EVs continue to break records around the world, governments and carmakers are increasingly concerned about the persistent shortages of lithium, nickel and cobalt, which could put the net-zero transition under threat.</p><h3><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3231316/catl-produce-worlds-fastest-ev-battery-offers-400km-driving-range-just-10-minutes-charging-keep" title="">CATL to make battery offering 400km driving range from 10-minute charge</a></h3><p>S&amp;P Global forecast that a more than 270 per cent increase in lithium production levels is needed to meet the estimated demand from the EV battery sector by 2030. Nickel and cobalt are also expected to be critical, but to a lesser degree as the deployment of iron-based chemistries will remedy their potential shortage, it said.</p><p>The Fujian-based company is willing to share its technologies and help overseas carmakers address their battery shortages, Zeng said. By 2042, China will no longer need to mine new mineral materials because of its mature battery recycling market, he added.</p><p>CATL is increasingly <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3215488/tesla-talks-catl-chinas-leading-ev-battery-maker-building-plant-us" target="_self" title="">expanding its capacity overseas</a> with plants in Germany and Hungary. It is also partnering with Amsterdam-based multinational carmaker Stellantis and Ford Motor to build battery factories in Europe and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3210118/chinas-catl-provide-know-how-fords-new-us35-billion-electric-car-battery-plant-us" target="_self" title="">Michigan in the US</a>.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
</div><p>As an essential part of decarbonising the automotive ecosystem, the EV transition requires technological innovation, a sustainable and responsible supply chain and the concerted efforts of all stakeholders, Zeng said during another panel on Thursday.</p><p>Advancing mining and refinery technology helps to increase the supply of lithium and to alleviate shortages, he said. Increasing energy density helps improve material efficiency and therefore reduces the demand for raw materials.</p><p>Finding an alternative at lower costs, such as sodium-ion batteries or cobalt-free cathode materials, is also a solution for reducing dependency on critical materials such as lithium, he said.</p><p>According to Zeng, CATL introduced its first generation of sodium-ion batteries in 2021 and is currently working on its second generation, which will give cars a driving range of 400 to 500 kilometres per charge.</p> ]]></description>

Important measures include setting up economic demonstration zones and test bases for low-flying aircraft. The plan includes the construction of infrastructure to integrate flying vehicles into urban transport and the daily commute.</p><p>While US flying car companies such as Kittyhawk (backed by Google founder Larry Page) shut down in 2022 due to commercialising and scaling difficulties, China’s policy support is fostering a more conducive ecosystem for nascent technologies like this to advance and benefit society.</p><p>Xpeng’s AeroHT eVTOL, for instance, unlike other flying vehicles such as by German company Volocopter and Hyundai’s Supernal, which was showcased at CES 2024, can transform between terrestrial and aerial modes.</p><p>While the inventions by Volocopter and Supernal resemble personal helicopters, Xpeng’s AeroHT eVTOL has propellers that emerge in flying mode and fold into the car’s body after use. This allows it to navigate road traffic and fit into a standard car park space.</p><div class="image-inline-container"><figure><img alt="People view the XPeng AeroHT “modular flying car” at the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 11.

Photo: AFP</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another factor that enhances the research and development of flying cars in China is close public-private collaboration. For instance, in 2021, the Guangdong government <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3125538/china-electric-cars-xpeng-receives-us77-million-investment" target="_self" title="">invested 500 million yuan</a> (US$70 million) in Xpeng. Guangdong’s Zhaoqing city has also supported Xpeng’s expansion, last year signing an investment agreement for a project worth 2 billion yuan. This type of financial and infrastructural support creates a nurturing ecosystem that enables Chinese EV makers to quickly transform concept cars into mass products.</p><p>China has highlighted the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3245769/chinas-low-altitude-economy-set-take-vast-potential-could-contribute-us700-billion-2025" target="_self" title="">low-altitude economy</a> as a core industry, deserving of special attention, at its annual <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3244856/chinas-development-biggest-political-priority-key-econ-meeting-leaders-vow-counter-risks-lift" target="_self" title="">central economic work conference</a> last month, together with artificial intelligence, the digital economy, green energy, biomedicine and private space flight. The vision is for China to address its economic challenges by investing in technology and industry, unlocking the country’s growth potential.</p><p>In addition to flying cars, drones are another area of China’s low-altitude economy that promises to revolutionise its agriculture, delivery services, emergency responses and more. Already, Shenzhen, China’s hi-tech hub, has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3246693/chinas-low-altitude-economy-takes-skies-unmanned-passenger-drone-completes-maiden-commercial-flight" target="_self" title="">declared plans</a> to build itself a “city in the sky”.</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/2184687/how-dji-went-university-dorm-project-worlds-biggest-drone-company" target="_self" title="">China’s DJI</a> is the world’s largest drone manufacturer with 70 per cent of the global market share. Its drone technology has helped in the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/2183603/drone-maker-dji-eyes-enterprise-business-transformation-hardware-maker" target="_self" title="">automation of farming</a>, including planning, sowing, weeding, watering and monitoring crop growth. Food delivery platform Meituan, for example, has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3224049/how-chinese-tech-giant-meituan-cracked-food-delivery-drone-densely-built-shenzhen-and-implications" target="_self" title="">embraced drones</a>, speeding up its commercial transactions and slashing its labour cost. In 2022, the drone industry in Shenzhen alone generated a market value of 75 billion yuan.</p><div class="methode-html-wrapper oembed-wrapper">
